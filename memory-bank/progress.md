# Project Progress

## Current Status:
- **Access Key Display on Supplier Creation:**
    - Modified `src/app/acciones/ProveedorActions.js` to return the generated access key when a new supplier is created, allowing administrators to view it.
- **Supplier Portal Enhancement Completed:**
    - Implemented a dedicated and secure section for suppliers to access their order information without exposing user data.
    - Developed a new authentication mechanism for suppliers using unique access keys, integrated with the existing login flow.
    - Updated data models, server actions, NextAuth.js configuration, and middleware to support supplier-specific authentication and session management.
    - Created new frontend pages (`src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` and `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/ver/[id]/page.jsx`) for supplier order listing and detail viewing.
    - Refactored the main supplier portal page (`src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`) to align with the new functionality and remove outdated sections.
    - Ensured strict data scoping for suppliers, allowing them to view only their own orders.
- **Login Page Visibility and Functionality Fixed:**
    - Identified and resolved middleware configuration issues that were preventing the login page from rendering correctly.
    - Ensured proper loading of Next.js static assets and NextAuth.js API routes by adjusting middleware matching rules and public paths.
    - Addressed Next.js Server Actions serialization limitations by ensuring plain object returns from error handling (`src/utils/errorHandler.js`).
    - Corrected client-side login flow logic in `src/components/layout/general/forms/FormLogin.jsx` to accurately reflect `signIn` success/failure and prevent contradictory messages.
    - Resolved a compilation error due to duplicate export in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`.
- **Changes Uploaded:**
    - All recent modifications, including updates to payment and order actions, error handling improvements, and memory bank documentation, have been staged, committed, and pushed to the `refactorizacion` branch.

## Next Steps:
- The access key display on supplier creation is implemented in the backend. Frontend integration is required to display the key to the administrator.
- The supplier portal enhancement is complete and ready for testing and review.
- The login page visibility and functionality issues have been resolved and are ready for verification.
