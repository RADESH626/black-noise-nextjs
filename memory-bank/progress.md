# Project Progress

## Current Status:
- The `Pedido` model has been updated to include a `paymentId` field, ensuring a direct link to the payment transaction.
- The `GestionDePedidosYPagos.md` documentation has been updated to reflect this change and the "payment first" flow.
- The `Pago` model now correctly uses the centralized `MetodoPago` enum, replacing hardcoded values.
- The `PaymentForm.jsx` component has been updated to utilize the `MetodoPago` enum for payment method selection.
- A new directive has been added to `improvement_log.md` to ensure future enum reusability.
- The `Genero` enum has been correctly exported in `src/models/enums/usuario/index.js`.
- The profile page data fetching has been optimized on the client-side by ensuring `userDesigns` are re-fetched after a new design upload, improving UI consistency.
- Resolved repeated client-side console logs in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` by moving them into a `useEffect` hook, ensuring they run only once on component mount.
- Implemented a shopping cart icon in the `HeaderPrincipal.jsx` component.
- Created a `CartModal.jsx` component that displays a preview of cart items (image, name, price, quantity) and a message for an empty cart.
- Reintroduced the dedicated `/carrito` page, rendering the `CartComponent` for a full cart view.
- The cart icon in the header now toggles the `CartModal` and fetches cart data.
- Added a directive to `.clinerules` to enforce the use of path aliases for imports.
- Refactored the `CartModal` to be a dropdown-style modal, similar to the profile menu, addressing the user's request for a transparent background behind the modal.
- Fixed `ReferenceError: handleCartIconClick is not defined` in `HeaderPrincipal.jsx` by ensuring the function and ref declaration were correctly included.
- Uncommented the `DesignGrid` component in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to enable design display.
- Implemented `cartItems` state and fetch logic in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to correctly pass cart data to `DesignGrid`, resolving the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'some')" error.
- Corrected the syntax error in `src/components/catalogo/DesignGrid.jsx` related to `cartItems.some`.
- Fixed `Error: useModal is not defined` in `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` by importing `usePopUp` and replacing the incorrect hook usage.
- Enhanced the `/carrito` page to display design descriptions and categories, and removed the shipping cost display, showing only the subtotal and total.
- Fixed an issue where updating cart item quantity with an empty or invalid input caused a "Cast to Number failed" validation error by ensuring the raw string value is passed and parsed/validated in the correct component.
- Resolved a TypeScript error (`Se esperaba '...'`) in `CartItem.jsx` by refining the JSX structure and ensuring proper `alt` attribute for images.
- Optimized cart item quantity updates to prevent full component re-renders by updating the `cartItems` state locally instead of refetching the entire cart, and by memoizing `CartItem` and stabilizing callback functions in `CartComponent`.
- Extended local state updates to `handleAddItem`, `handleRemoveItem`, and `handleClearCart` in `CartComponent.jsx` to prevent full component re-renders on all cart modifications.
- Prevented the "Cargando" message from appearing during quantity updates by removing global loading state triggers from `handleUpdateQuantity`.
- Added subtotal display for each design item in `src/components/common/CartItem.jsx`.
- Resolved a syntax error in `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` by wrapping multiple JSX elements in a React Fragment.
- Resolved a runtime error in `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` by importing the `Link` component from `next/link`.
- Implemented a global cart state using `CartContext.jsx` to manage the global state of the shopping cart, including `cartItems`, loading status, and error handling.
- Integrated `CartProvider` into `SessionProviderWrapper.jsx` to make the cart context available throughout the application.
- Refactored `HeaderPrincipal.jsx` to consume `cartItems` from `CartContext`, enabling the cart icon to dynamically display the number of items.
- Refactored `CartComponent.jsx` to utilize `cartItems`, `loadingCart`, `cartError`, and `updateCart` from `CartContext`, centralizing its state management.
- Enhanced Cart Actions: Modified `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js` (specifically `removeDesignFromCart` and `clearUserCart`) to ensure all cart-related server actions consistently return the updated cart data, facilitating seamless global state synchronization.
- Refactored Catalog Page for Real-time Updates: Modified `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to remove local cart state and integrate with the global `CartContext`. The `handleAddItemToCart` function now updates the global cart state after a successful addition, ensuring the cart icon and design status in the catalog update in real-time.
- Verified DesignGrid Usage: Confirmed that `src/components/catalogo/DesignGrid.jsx` correctly receives and utilizes the `cartItems` prop from its parent to display whether a design is in the cart.
- Fixed Design Status in Catalog: Corrected the logic in `src/components/catalogo/DesignGrid.jsx` to ensure that designs already in the cart correctly display their status (e.g., "En el carrito" en lugar de "Agregar al carrito"). This was achieved by ensuring a consistent type comparison (`item.id === dise√±o._id.toString()`) when checking if a design is in the cart.
- **Fixed React Warning: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop"** in `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` by ensuring a stable and unique key for `CartItem` components.
- **Fixed Runtime Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')"**: This error occurred in `src/components/common/CartItem.jsx` because `item.price` or `item.quantity` were `undefined` when `toFixed()` was called.
    -   **Correction:** Modified `src/components/common/CartItem.jsx` to safely access `item.price` and `item.quantity` using the nullish coalescing operator (`?? 0`) before performing calculations or calling `toFixed()`.
-   **Missing Design Details After Quantity Update:** When updating the quantity of designs, only price and subtotal were rendered, and full design details were missing.
    -   **Correction:** Modified `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js` to ensure that `updateCartItemQuantity` returns the fully populated cart data, including all design details, after a quantity update.
-   **Quantity 0 does not remove item from UI:** When a user set the quantity of an item to 0, the item remained in the UI with a quantity of 0 instead of being removed.
    -   **Correction:** Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` to filter out items from the `cartItems` state when their `newQuantity` is 0, ensuring immediate UI removal.
-   **Implemented Optimistic Updates and Debouncing for Cart Actions:** Refactored `handleAddItem`, `handleRemoveItem`, and `handleClearCart` in `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` to:
    *   Perform immediate optimistic UI updates on user action.
    *   Use separate `useRef` debouncers for each action to delay server synchronization calls (`addDesignToCart`, `removeDesignFromCart`, `clearUserCart`) by 1000ms.
    *   Implement rollback logic to revert client-side state if the server update fails.
    *   Adjusted the debounce time for `handleUpdateQuantity` to 1000ms for consistency.
-   **Refactored Catalog Page for Optimistic Add to Cart:** Applied the optimistic update and debounced synchronization pattern to `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`. The `handleAddItemToCart` function now:
    *   Optimistically adds the design to the cart state immediately.
    *   Uses `useRef` and `setTimeout` to debounce the `addDesignToCart` server action.
    *   Includes rollback logic to revert the UI state if the server action fails.
    *   Removed `alert` calls, relying on console logs for now.
-   **Implemented Optimistic Updates and Debouncing for User Design Management:** Applied the optimistic update and debouncing pattern to the user's design management in the profile page (`/perfil`).
    *   **Modified `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx`**: Added "Edit" and "Delete" buttons, conditionally rendered based on a new `mode` prop ('profile' vs 'catalog').
    *   **Created `src/components/perfil/FormEditarDesign.jsx`**: A new client component for editing design details, utilizing `actualizarDesign` server action.
    *   **Modified `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`**:
        *   Implemented `handleDeleteDesign` with optimistic UI updates (removes design immediately), debouncing (`eliminarDesign` server action after 500ms), and rollback on error.
        *   Implemented `handleUpdateDesign` with optimistic UI updates (updates design details immediately), debouncing (`actualizarDesign` server action after 500ms), and rollback on error.
        *   Updated `handleEditDesign` to open `FormEditarDesign` modal, passing design data and `handleUpdateDesign` as a callback.
        *   Passed `mode="profile"`, `handleEditDesign`, and `handleDeleteDesign` to `DesignsComponent`.
        *   Removed unnecessary `cartItems` and `orderedDesignIds` props from `DesignsComponent` when in 'profile' mode.
    *   Removed `onPaymentSuccess={fetchCartData}` from `PedidosComponent` as `fetchCartData` was not defined in this context.
-   **Implemented Optimistic Updates and Rollback for Admin User Profile Picture Management:**
    *   **Modified `src/app/admin/users/page.jsx`**: Implemented optimistic UI updates for profile picture changes, displaying the new image immediately after selection.
    *   Added a loading state to the update button to prevent multiple submissions.
    *   Implemented rollback logic to revert to the previous profile picture if the `actualizarFotoPerfilUsuarioPorAdmin` server action fails.
    *   **Created `memory-bank/functionalities/AdminUserManagement.md`**: Documented the new functionality and the application of optimistic updates and rollback.
-   **Implemented Optimistic Updates and Rollback for Admin Design Editing:**
    *   **Modified `src/app/admin/designs/editar/[id]/page.jsx`**: Implemented optimistic UI updates for design details (name, description, price, category, and image preview) upon form submission.
    *   Utilized the existing loading state to prevent multiple submissions.
    *   Implemented rollback logic to revert to the previous design details if the `actualizarDesign` server action fails.
    *   **Created `memory-bank/functionalities/AdminDesignManagement.md`**: Documented the new functionality and the application of optimistic updates and rollback.
-   **Implemented Optimistic Updates and Rollback for Supplier Profile Editing:**
    *   **Modified `src/components/layout/proveedor/forms/FormEditarPerfilProveedor.jsx`**: Implemented optimistic UI updates for supplier profile details (name, address, payment methods, availability, credit permissions) upon form submission.
    *   Utilized a loading state to prevent multiple submissions.
    *   Implemented rollback logic to revert to the previous profile details if the `actualizarProveedor` server action fails.
    *   **Created `memory-bank/functionalities/SupplierProfileManagement.md`**: Documented the new functionality and the application of optimistic updates and rollback.
-   **Fixed Catalog Page Button Reversion:** Resolved the issue where "Add to Cart" buttons for other designs would revert to their original state after adding an item. This was addressed by:
    *   Memoizing `DesignCard.jsx` with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    *   Memoizing `DesignGrid.jsx` with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    *   Ensuring the `cartItems` array passed from `CartContext` is consistently updated with the complete server-side cart state.
    *   **Modified `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js`:** Updated `addDesignToCart` to return the fully populated and formatted cart data (with `id` as string) after adding/updating an item, ensuring consistency with client-side expectations.

## Remaining Tasks:
- The task of applying the client-side data management approach (optimistic updates, debouncing, rollback) to "other pages" has been completed for all identified suitable candidates.
- `src/app/pedido/page.jsx`: Reviewed and determined that no direct interactive elements for order status changes exist on this page that would benefit from optimistic updates, as the "payment first" flow is already implemented.
- `src/components/layout/admin/pedidos/forms/FormEditarPedido.jsx`: Reviewed and found to be a placeholder component with no current functionality for editing orders, thus no optimistic updates could be applied at this time.
- The current task is considered complete.
