# Progress

## What Works
- Initial project setup with Next.js.
- Basic file structure for pages, API routes, components, contexts, and models.
- Placeholder files for various functionalities (e.g., user management, design management, authentication).
- MongoDB connection utility (`src/utils/DBconection.js`) is in place, indicating readiness for database interactions.
- NextAuth.js setup is indicated by the presence of `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` and `src/app/SessionProviderWrapper.jsx`.

## What's Left to Build
- **Complete User Authentication Flows:** Implement full registration, login, logout, and profile editing logic, including password hashing and secure session management.
- **Admin Dashboard Functionality:** Develop all CRUD operations for users, designs, suppliers, orders, and payments.
- **Supplier Portal Functionality:** Implement supplier profile management and order viewing.
- **Product Catalog:** Develop pages for displaying products, including filtering, sorting, and individual product detail pages.
- **Shopping Cart and Checkout:** Implement the full e-commerce flow from adding items to cart to completing a secure payment.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with a chosen payment provider.
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Implement robust error handling across the application (frontend and backend) and input validation.
- **Styling and Responsiveness:** Apply consistent styling and ensure the application is fully responsive.
- **Testing:** Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Set up continuous integration and deployment.

## Current Status
The project is in its early stages of development. The foundational structure is in place, and the memory bank has been initialized to document the project's context and progress. Core functionalities like authentication and database interaction are set up at a basic level, but require full implementation.

## Known Issues
- No known issues at this initial stage, as core features are not yet fully implemented or tested.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to use Next.js for a full-stack approach is confirmed, simplifying the tech stack.
- The modular structure is intended to promote maintainability and scalability.
- The memory bank itself is a new decision to ensure consistent context and knowledge transfer.
