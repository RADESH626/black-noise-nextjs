   - Enhance form components with sample data auto-fill
   - Implement mock data in product catalog and shopping cart

2. **Advanced Data Scenarios**
   - Add error state simulations and edge cases
   - Implement loading state mockups
   - Create performance testing scenarios

3. **Real Data Integration**
   - Begin connecting mock patterns to actual API calls
   - Implement data fetching strategies
   - Create smooth transition mechanisms from mock to production

4. **Provider Management System**
   - Review and potentially refactor provider-related forms
   - Enhance provider CRUD operations with mock data

5. **Order Management System**
   - Modernize order processing forms
   - Implement Server Actions for order workflows

## Code Quality Standards Maintained

- âœ… Modern React patterns (useActionState, useFormStatus)
- âœ… Server-side form processing
- âœ… Proper error handling and validation
- âœ… Type safety with FormData
- âœ… Automatic UI updates
- âœ… Loading states and user feedback
- âœ… Clean code architecture
- âœ… Consistent naming conventions
- âœ… Environment-based feature activation
- âœ… Production safety measures

## Current Architecture

### User Management
- **Frontend**: Modern React forms with Server Actions
- **Backend**: Robust Server Actions for all user operations
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: NextAuth integration
- **File Handling**: Server-side upload processing

### Mock Data System
- **Structure**: Organized entity-based data files
- **Access**: Custom hook with unified interface
- **Integration**: Seamless development experience
- **Production**: Safe environment-controlled activation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage guides

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Forms**: Server Actions with useActionState/useFormStatus
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **File Upload**: Server-side processing with FormData
- **Development**: Mock data system for visual testing

## Performance Improvements Achieved

1. **Reduced Client-Side JavaScript**: Server Actions minimize client bundle size
