# Project Progress Tracker

## Current Status: ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS - Color Palette Implementation

### Recently Completed Tasks

#### âœ… Session Validation Reintegration (Session 9 - Completed)
**Date**: July 6, 2025
**Objective**: Reintegrate session validation in the project by enabling the production middleware.

**Completed Items**:
1. **Middleware Configuration**:
   - Changed `export default developmentMiddleware;` to `export default productionMiddleware;` in `src/middleware.js`.
   - Removed the `developmentMiddleware` function.

**Technical Achievements**:
- Re-enabled full session validation and role-based redirection for all routes.
- Removed temporary development bypasses from the middleware.

#### âœ… Proveedor Entity Refactoring (Session 7 - Completed)
**Date**: June 6, 2025
**Objective**: Refactor the "Proveedor" entity logic to eliminate the internal API Route layer, making Server Actions communicate directly with the database.

**Completed Items**:
1.  **Direct Database Interaction**: All `fetch` calls to internal API routes in `src/app/acciones/ProveedorActions.js` were replaced with direct Mongoose operations.
2.  **Comprehensive CRUD Operations**: Implemented `obtenerProveedores`, `obtenerMiPerfilProveedor`, `actualizarPerfilProveedor`, `crearProveedor`, `eliminarProveedor`, `obtenerProveedorPorId`, and `actualizarProveedor` directly interacting with the database.
3.  **Cache Revalidation**: Integrated `revalidatePath('/admin/proveedores')` and `revalidatePath('/proveedor/editar-perfil')` into all mutation functions.
4.  **Robust Error Handling**: Ensured consistent error object returns and specific handling for duplicate key errors.
5.  **Data Serialization**: Implemented `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data))` for all Mongoose query results to ensure compatibility with Next.js Server Actions.

**Technical Achievements**:
-   Eliminated redundant API Route layer for `Proveedor` entity.
-   Centralized all `Proveedor` business logic in `ProveedorActions.js`.
-   Improved performance by reducing network overhead.
-   Enhanced maintainability and debugging.

#### âœ… Entity Refactoring (Session 8 - Completed)
**Date**: June 6, 2025
