# Project Progress Tracker

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED - User Forms Server Actions Refactoring

### Recently Completed Tasks

#### ✅ User Management Forms Refactoring (Session 5 - Completed)
**Date**: January 26, 2025
**Objective**: Refactor all user-related forms to use Next.js 14+ Server Actions pattern

**Completed Items**:
1. **FormAgregarUsuarios.jsx** - Admin user creation form
   - ✅ Refactored to use `useActionState` with `addSingleUserAction`
   - ✅ Implemented `useFormStatus` for loading states
   - ✅ Fixed field name mapping (`telefono` → `numeroTelefono`)
   - ✅ Integrated with PopUp context for user feedback

2. **Server Actions Infrastructure**:
   - ✅ Fixed syntax errors in `guardarUsuarios` function
   - ✅ Enhanced `addSingleUserAction` for admin user creation
   - ✅ Proper field mapping and validation
   - ✅ Automatic page revalidation after mutations

3. **Verified All Other Forms Already Modernized**:
   - ✅ FormEditarUsuario.jsx (admin edit + profile edit)
   - ✅ FormCargaMasivaUsuarios.jsx (bulk upload)
   - ✅ FormFiltrarUsuarios.jsx (search/filter with table)
   - ✅ FormRegistro.jsx (public registration)
