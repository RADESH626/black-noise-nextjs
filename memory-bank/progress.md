### ๐ง In Progress Tasks

#### ๐ง Color Palette Implementation
**Date**: May 27, 2025
**Branch**: `feature/color-palette`
**Objective**: Create and apply a color palette to the project based on the "Black Noise" theme.

**Completed Items This Session**:
- Defined color palette in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.js`.
- Applied primary/secondary colors to the main layout (`src/app/layout.jsx`).
- Applied accent and primary colors to the general button component (`src/components/common/botones/BotonGeneral.jsx`), then reverted to white/pink gradient with black text as requested.
- Applied neutral and accent colors to the general input component and label (`src/components/common/inputs/InputGeneral.jsx`).
- Applied neutral and accent colors to the modal component (`src/components/common/modales/Modal.jsx`).
- Applied neutral and secondary colors to the popup text and icons (`src/components/common/modales/PopUpMessage.jsx`).
- Applied consistent styling to forms in `src/components/layout/general/forms/`, `src/components/layout/admin/usuarios/forms/`, `src/components/layout/admin/solicitudes-proveedor/forms/`, and `src/components/layout/proveedor/forms/`, including labels, input icons, container backgrounds/borders/text, select inputs, and checkboxes.

**Next Steps**:
1. Continue applying the color palette to other common components (e.g., tables, navigation).
2. Apply the color palette to specific pages and sections of the application.
3. Review the UI to ensure consistent application of the palette and make adjustments as needed.

# Progress

## What Works
- The Next.js application structure is set up.
- Initial authentication and authorization middleware was in place.
- All routes are now accessible without validation for frontend development purposes.
- A session simulation button and associated context/hook have been implemented for visual testing of authenticated/unauthenticated views.
- The main header (`HeaderPrincipal`) now conditionally displays a user icon when a session is active, and clicking it opens a **dropdown menu** with "Ver Perfil" and "Cerrar Sesiรณn" options, positioned next to the profile picture.
- A data simulation button and associated context/hook have been implemented for visual testing and development purposes.
- `UserContext` has been successfully eliminated.
- `src/app/layout.jsx` has been updated to remove `UserProvider`.
- `src/components/common/modales/NewOrderModal.jsx` has been refactored to use `useSession` from `next-auth/react` and `ObtenerUsuarioPorCorreo` from `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions` based on the session email.
- The `/catalogo` view has been transformed into a social media-like page, including user avatars, like and share buttons, and a "Publicar Diseรฑo" section.
- Mock design data from `src/data/mock/designs.js` is now integrated into the `/catalogo` view.
- Client-side logic has been implemented for a like/unlike toggle functionality on designs using `localStorage`, with visual feedback (outline/filled heart icon).
- The "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in `/catalogo` has been resolved by memoizing data arrays using `useMemo`.
- The `/perfil` view now implements a tabbed interface in `ProfileContent.jsx`, allowing conditional rendering of `DesignsComponent` and `PedidosComponent` based on the active tab ("DISEรOS" or "PEDIDOS").
- The `useRouter` import and initialization were removed from `ProfileContent.jsx`.
- `DesignsComponent.jsx` was created to encapsulate the design display logic.
- `PedidosComponent.jsx` was updated to fetch and display order data using `obtenerPedidosPorUsuarioId`, handling loading and error states.

## What's Left to Build
- Revert or adjust middleware for production environment.
- Continue with frontend development, now that route access is unrestricted and session simulation/data simulation are available.
- **Debugging:** Resolve the issue where the user icon and login button are not reacting correctly to the simulated session state in the header.

## Current Status
- All necessary code modifications have been implemented to disable NextAuth.js authentication for development purposes, including changes to `src/app/login/page.jsx`, `src/middleware.js`, `src/app/layout.jsx`, and `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`.
- The session simulation feature has been fully implemented, including:
    - `src/context/MockSessionContext.jsx` (with added debug `console.log`)
    - `src/components/common/SessionToggleButton.jsx`
    - `src/hooks/useSimulatedSession.js`
    - Integration into `src/app/layout.jsx`
    - Usage in `src/app/perfil/ProfileContent.jsx`
- The user profile icon and **dropdown menu** functionality have been integrated into `src/components/layout/general/HeaderPrincipal.jsx`.
- The data simulation feature has been fully implemented, including:
    - `src/context/MockDataContext.jsx`
    - `src/hooks/useMockData.js`
    - `src/components/common/MockDataToggleButton.jsx`
    - Integration into `src/app/layout.jsx`
- `UserContext` has been removed, and `NewOrderModal.jsx` has been refactored to fetch user data directly using `useSession` and `ObtenerUsuarioPorCorreo`.
- The `/catalogo` view has been updated to display designs in a social media-like format, using mock data, and includes a "Publicar Diseรฑo" button.
- The like functionality in `/catalogo` now supports a like/unlike toggle per design per user (client-side, via `localStorage`), with visual feedback (outline/filled heart icon).
- A message "No hay diseรฑos disponibles" is displayed when no designs are present in the `/catalogo` view.

## Known Issues
- The current middleware configuration is not suitable for production as it bypasses all authentication.
- **Persistent Environmental Issue:** Despite correct code changes, the Next.js development server appears to be aggressively caching or failing to hot-reload fundamental configuration changes, leading to persistent 401 Unauthorized errors and redirects. A full manual server restart (`Ctrl+C` and `npm run dev`) is likely required for changes to take effect.
- **Session Simulation Display Issue:** The `HeaderPrincipal` component is not correctly updating its display (user icon appearing, login button disappearing) when the session simulation button is toggled. Debugging steps have been initiated by adding a `console.log` in `MockSessionContext.jsx`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decision to temporarily disable route validation to accelerate frontend development.
- Decision to implement client-side session and data simulation for visual testing, separate from NextAuth.js's actual authentication flow, to provide a quick way to toggle between authenticated/unauthenticated views and mock data during development.
- Decision to integrate a user profile icon and **dropdown menu** into the main header for session-dependent navigation and actions.
- Decision to eliminate `UserContext` and centralize user data fetching through NextAuth.js session and a server action (`ObtenerUsuarioPorCorreo`) for a cleaner architecture.
- **Product Decision:** Comments are intentionally not implemented for designs to avoid potential negative opinions.
- **Workflow Insight:** When a task is denied, it's often because the project is already running, and I should avoid restarting the server unless explicitly necessary.
- **UI/UX Adaptation:** Adapted the `/catalogo` view to a social media-like interface while adhering to product decisions regarding feature exclusion (e.g., comments) and implementing client-side like prevention.
