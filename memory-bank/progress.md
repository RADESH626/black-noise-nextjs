# Project Progress

## Current Status:
- The `Pedido` model has been updated to include a `paymentId` field, ensuring a direct link to the payment transaction.
- The `GestionDePedidosYPagos.md` documentation has been updated to reflect this change and the "payment first" flow.
- The `Pago` model now correctly uses the centralized `MetodoPago` enum, replacing hardcoded values.
- The `PaymentForm.jsx` component has been updated to utilize the `MetodoPago` enum for payment method selection.
- A new directive has been added to `improvement_log.md` to ensure future enum reusability.
- The `Genero` enum has been correctly exported in `src/models/enums/usuario/index.js`.
- The profile page data fetching has been optimized on the client-side by ensuring `userDesigns` are re-fetched after a new design upload, improving UI consistency.
- Resolved repeated client-side console logs in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` by moving them into a `useEffect` hook, ensuring they run only once on component mount.
- Implemented a shopping cart icon in the `HeaderPrincipal.jsx` component.
- Created a `CartModal.jsx` component that displays a preview of cart items (image, name, price, quantity) and a message for an empty cart.
- Reintroduced the dedicated `/carrito` page, rendering the `CartComponent` for a full cart view.
- The cart icon in the header now toggles the `CartModal` and fetches cart data.
- Added a directive to `.clinerules` to enforce the use of path aliases for imports.
- Refactored the `CartModal` to be a dropdown-style modal, similar to the profile menu, addressing the user's request for a transparent background behind the modal.
- Fixed `ReferenceError: handleCartIconClick is not defined` in `HeaderPrincipal.jsx` by ensuring the function and ref declaration were correctly included.
- Uncommented the `DesignGrid` component in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to enable design display.
- Implemented `cartItems` state and fetch logic in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to correctly pass cart data to `DesignGrid`, resolving the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'some')" error.
- Corrected the syntax error in `src/components/catalogo/DesignGrid.jsx` related to `cartItems.some`.

## Remaining Tasks:
