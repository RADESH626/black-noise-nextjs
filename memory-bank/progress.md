# Project Progress

## Current Status:
- **Modal Styling:** Improved the visual appearance of modals, specifically the "add supplier modal," by removing unwanted backdrops, adjusting content width for better layout, implementing a robust centering mechanism for the modal, and fixing the nested heading issue.
- **Server Action Error Handling:** Resolved the issue where class instances were being passed from Server Components to Client Components, ensuring that all error responses are plain JavaScript objects.
- **Proveedor Validation Error:** Fixed the validation error when creating a supplier by correctly parsing `especialidad` and `metodosPagoAceptados` fields into arrays of individual enum values.
- **Supplier Dashboard Redirection Fix:** Implemented a comprehensive fix for the supplier dashboard redirection issue. The root cause was identified as the `authorize` callback in NextAuth incorrectly setting `isSupplier: false` for users with `rol: PROVEEDOR` due to an authentication flow logic error. This has been corrected by refactoring the `authorize` callback to correctly fetch and combine `Usuario` and `Proveedor` data for supplier logins, ensuring `isSupplier: true` and `proveedorId` are correctly propagated to the session. All temporary debugging changes have been reverted.
- **"Only plain objects" Error Fix:** Resolved the error by applying `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to data returned from `guardarPedido` and `toPlainObject` to data returned from `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`, ensuring all data passed to client components is properly serialized.
- **Custom Header in Supplier View:** Implemented a new, exclusive header component (`HeaderProveedor.jsx`) for the supplier view (`src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`). This header displays the app title ("Black Noise") on the left, the logged-in supplier's name on the right, and now includes a "Cerrar Sesi√≥n" (Logout) button, which utilizes the `BotonGeneral` component with `text-black` styling, fulfilling the user's specific request.

## Completed Tasks:
- Initial project setup and configuration.
- Implementation of core functionalities (e.g., user authentication, product catalog).
- Refactoring efforts as per `refactoring_plan.md` (if applicable, check `refactoring_complete.md`).
- Server Action error handling fix.
- Fixing Proveedor Validation Error.
- Fixing supplier dashboard redirection.
- Fixing "Only plain objects" error.
- Implemented custom header for supplier view.

## Pending Tasks:
- Further UI/UX improvements as identified.
- Bug fixes and optimizations.

## Next Steps:
- Continue with any new tasks or identified improvements.
