# Project Progress

## Current Status:
- **Modal Styling:** Improved the visual appearance of modals, specifically the "add supplier modal," by removing unwanted backdrops, adjusting content width for better layout, implementing a robust centering mechanism for the modal, and fixing the nested heading issue.
- **Server Action Error Handling:** Resolved the issue where class instances were being passed from Server Components to Client Components, ensuring that all error responses are plain JavaScript objects.
- **Proveedor Validation Error:** Fixed the validation error when creating a supplier by correctly parsing `especialidad` and `metodosPagoAceptados` fields into arrays of individual enum values.
- **Supplier Dashboard Redirection Fix:** Implemented a comprehensive fix for the supplier dashboard redirection issue. The root cause was identified as the `authorize` callback in NextAuth incorrectly setting `isSupplier: false` for users with `rol: PROVEEDOR` due to an authentication flow logic error. This has been corrected by refactoring the `authorize` callback to correctly fetch and combine `Usuario` and `Proveedor` data for supplier logins, ensuring `isSupplier: true` and `proveedorId` are correctly propagated to the session. All temporary debugging changes have been reverted.
- **"Only plain objects" Error Fix:** Resolved the error by applying `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to data returned from `guardarPedido` and `toPlainObject` to data returned from `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`, ensuring all data passed to client components is properly serialized.
- **Custom Header in Supplier View:** Implemented a new, exclusive header component (`HeaderProveedor.jsx`) for the supplier view (`src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`). This header displays the app title ("Black Noise") on the left, the logged-in supplier's name on the right, and now includes a "Cerrar Sesión" (Logout) button, which utilizes the `BotonGeneral` component with `text-black` styling, fulfilling the user's specific request.
- **Supplier Page Refresh & Flicker Fix (Refined Loading State & Auth Check):** Addressed the issue where the supplier page (`/proveedor`) was unnecessarily re-fetching data and showing a loading spinner upon re-entry, and also the flickering when switching tabs. The `useEffect` hook in `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` has been modified to conditionally fetch data only if the `miPerfil` state is `null` or `undefined`. Additionally, the loading state management has been refined by initializing `loading` based on `useSession`'s initial `status` and explicitly setting `loading` to `false` when `miPerfil` is loaded. The conditional rendering of the `LoadingSpinner` now combines `status === "loading"` with `(loading && !miPerfil)`. Furthermore, the `session` and `isSupplier` authentication check has been moved from inside `useEffect` to the main render function of `ProveedorPage`, ensuring immediate and synchronous redirection for unauthorized users.
- **Removed Supplier Profile Editing:** Removed the "Gestión de Perfil" section and the "Editar Perfil" link from `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`, as per the user's request to restrict profile editing to administrators only.
- **React Query Integration for Data Caching:** Integrated `@tanstack/react-query` into the application. Configured `QueryClientProvider` in `src/app/layout.jsx` and refactored data fetching in both `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` (for supplier profile) and `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` (for designs) to use `useQuery`. This provides robust client-side caching, reducing unnecessary network requests and improving UI responsiveness.
- **Fixed "Only plain objects" Error with QueryClientProvider:** Resolved the serialization error by creating a dedicated client component (`src/app/providers.jsx`) to encapsulate the `QueryClient` instance creation and the `QueryClientProvider`, ensuring the `QueryClient` is instantiated in a client environment.
