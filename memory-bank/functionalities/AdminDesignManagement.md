# Admin Design Management - Edit Design

This document outlines the functionality for administrators to edit existing design details.

## Current Implementation

The `src/app/admin/designs/editar/[id]/page.jsx` component allows an administrator to edit the name, description, price, category, and image of a specific design. It fetches the design details using `encontrarDesignsPorId` and updates them using the `actualizarDesign` server action.

## Planned Enhancements: Optimistic UI Update and Rollback

To improve the user experience, the design editing process will be enhanced with optimistic UI updates and rollback capabilities:

1.  **Optimistic UI Update:** When an administrator submits changes to a design, the UI will immediately reflect the new details (name, description, price, category, and image preview), providing instant visual feedback.
2.  **Loading State:** The existing loading indicator will be utilized to prevent multiple submissions and inform the user that the operation is in progress.
3.  **Rollback on Error:** If the server action (`actualizarDesign`) fails for any reason, the UI will automatically revert to the previous design details, ensuring data consistency and clear error handling.

This approach aligns with the "Patrones de Sincronizaci√≥n de Datos" documented in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
