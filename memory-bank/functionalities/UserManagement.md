# User Management

This document outlines the functionalities related to user management, including registration, login, and logout.

## Logout Functionality

The logout functionality allows a user to end their active session. Upon successful logout, the user is redirected to the login page (`/login`) to ensure they must re-authenticate to access protected areas of the application.
