# Temporary Removal of Design Likes Functionality

## Objective
Temporarily disable and remove the "likes" functionality associated with designs in the application. This includes hiding the display of likes on the frontend and preventing the storage/retrieval of like counts in the backend.

## Scope
This is a **major scope** change as it affects both frontend display and backend data modeling.

## Changes to be Implemented

### 1. Frontend (`src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx`)
- Remove or comment out the display of `design.likes`.
- Remove or comment out any associated UI elements (buttons, icons) and client-side logic related to liking/unliking designs.

### 2. Backend (`src/models/Design.js`)
- Comment out the `likes` field in the `DesignSchema` to temporarily disable its use in the database model.

## Rationale for Temporary Removal
[To be filled by the user or based on further context if provided. For now, assume it's a business decision.]

## Reversibility
The changes are designed to be easily reversible by uncommenting the relevant code sections and re-enabling any removed UI elements.

## Verification Steps
- Navigate to the `/catalogo` page (or any page displaying designs).
- Verify that the "likes" count and any like/unlike interaction elements are no longer visible.
- Ensure the application functions correctly without errors related to the removed functionality.
