# Admin User Management - Profile Picture Update

This document outlines the functionality for administrators to update user profile pictures.

## Current Implementation

The `src/app/admin/users/page.jsx` component allows an administrator to select a user (currently a placeholder) and upload a new profile picture for them. It utilizes the `actualizarFotoPerfilUsuarioPorAdmin` server action to handle the image upload and update in the database.

## Planned Enhancements: Optimistic UI Update and Rollback

To improve the user experience, the profile picture update process will be enhanced with optimistic UI updates and rollback capabilities:

1.  **Optimistic UI Update:** When an administrator uploads a new profile picture, the UI will immediately reflect the new image, providing instant visual feedback.
2.  **Loading State:** A loading indicator will be displayed during the server request to prevent multiple submissions and inform the user that the operation is in progress.
3.  **Rollback on Error:** If the server action (`actualizarFotoPerfilUsuarioPorAdmin`) fails for any reason, the UI will automatically revert to the previous profile picture, ensuring data consistency and clear error handling.

This approach aligns with the "Patrones de Sincronizaci√≥n de Datos" documented in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
