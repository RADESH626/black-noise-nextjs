# Supplier Profile Management - Edit Profile

This document outlines the functionality for suppliers to edit their own profile details.

## Current Implementation

The `src/app/proveedor/editar-perfil/page.jsx` component fetches the supplier's profile and passes it to `src/components/layout/proveedor/forms/FormEditarPerfilProveedor.jsx`. This form allows the supplier to edit their profile details. The form submission likely interacts with a server action (e.g., `actualizarPerfilProveedor`).

## Planned Enhancements: Optimistic UI Update and Rollback

To improve the user experience, the supplier profile editing process will be enhanced with optimistic UI updates and rollback capabilities:

1.  **Optimistic UI Update:** When a supplier submits changes to their profile, the UI will immediately reflect the new details (e.g., name, contact information), providing instant visual feedback.
2.  **Loading State:** A loading indicator will be displayed during the server request to prevent multiple submissions and inform the user that the operation is in progress.
3.  **Rollback on Error:** If the server action (e.g., `actualizarPerfilProveedor`) fails for any reason, the UI will automatically revert to the previous profile details, ensuring data consistency and clear error handling.

This approach aligns with the "Patrones de Sincronizaci√≥n de Datos" documented in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
