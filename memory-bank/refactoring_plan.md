# Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the planned refactoring tasks for the project. Each item will be marked as complete once implemented and verified.

## Pending Tasks:

- [x] **Initial Refactoring Setup**:
    - [x] Create `refactoring_plan.md` (Done by Cline)
    - [x] Review existing codebase for immediate refactoring opportunities.
    - [x] Document initial refactoring goals in `refactoring_plan.md`.

## Proposed Refactoring Goals:

- [ ] **API Route Refactoring (`src/app/api/administrador/`)**:
    - [x] Implement consistent error handling across all API routes.
    - [x] Centralize input validation logic.
    - [x] Abstract common CRUD operations into reusable functions or a base handler to reduce code duplication.
    - [x] Ensure robust authentication and authorization checks are in place for all admin routes.

- [x] **Action Files Review (`src/app/acciones/`)**:
    - [x] Analyze `*Actions.js` files for complexity and redundancy.
    - [x] Refactor overly complex actions into smaller, more manageable functions.
    - [x] Identify and extract reusable logic into utility functions in `src/utils/`.

- [x] **Component Modularity (`src/app/*/page.jsx` and `src/components/`)**:
    - [x] Identify large `page.jsx` files and break down their content into smaller, more focused components. (Completed for `src/app/page.jsx`, `src/app/carrito/page.jsx`, `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`, `src/app/login/page.jsx`, `src/app/pago/page.jsx`)
    - [x] Move truly reusable UI components from page-specific directories (e.g., `src/app/perfil/`) to `src/components/common/` or `src/components/layout/` as appropriate. (Completed for `src/app/perfil/PedidosComponent.jsx`, `src/app/perfil/ProfileContent.jsx`, `src/app/perfil/CartComponent.jsx`, `src/app/perfil/DesignsComponent.jsx`, `src/app/perfil/PagosComponent.jsx`, `src/app/perfil/ProfileData.jsx` - deleted as redundant)
    - [x] Ensure components follow a clear separation of concerns (e.g., presentation vs. logic). (Addressed by modularization)

- [ ] **Global Styles Optimization (`src/app/globals.css`)**:
    - [ ] Assess the size and complexity of `globals.css`.
    - [ ] If necessary, propose a strategy for modularizing styles (e.g., using CSS Modules, Tailwind utility classes, or a component-based styling approach) to improve maintainability and reduce global scope pollution.

- [x] **Authentication Module Review (`src/app/api/auth/`)**:
    - [x] Verify the security and efficiency of authentication routes.
    - [x] Ensure proper session management and token handling.
