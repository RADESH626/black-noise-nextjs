## Why this project exists
The "Black Noise Next.js E-commerce" project aims to provide a dedicated online platform for selling custom clothing designs. The current market lacks a centralized, user-friendly platform that specializes in unique, customizable apparel, leading to fragmented sales channels and limited reach for designers. This project addresses that gap by offering a streamlined experience for both customers and designers/suppliers.

## Problems it solves
- **Limited Reach for Designers:** Designers often struggle to reach a broad audience for their custom clothing. This platform provides a wider marketplace.
- **Fragmented Customer Experience:** Customers interested in custom apparel often have to search across multiple small shops or social media, leading to an inconsistent shopping experience. This platform centralizes the process.
- **Inefficient Order Management:** Manual order processing for custom designs can be time-consuming and error-prone. The platform automates this.
- **Lack of Centralized Administration:** Managing users, designs, and suppliers across disparate systems is inefficient for business owners. The admin dashboard centralizes these operations.

## How it should work
The platform should offer distinct experiences for three main user roles:

### 1. Customer (General User)
- **Browsing:** Users can browse a catalog of custom clothing designs, categorized by type (e.g., t-shirts, hoodies, jackets).
- **Viewing Details:** Clicking on a design should display detailed information, including images, description, available sizes, and price. **Note: Comments are intentionally not implemented for designs to avoid potential negative opinions.**
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add designs to a shopping cart.
- **Checkout:** A secure checkout process allows users to complete purchases, including payment integration.
- **Profile Management:** Users can register, log in, and manage their personal information and order history.

### 2. Administrator
- **Dashboard Overview:** A central dashboard to monitor key metrics (sales, new users, pending orders).
- **User Management:** Add, edit, delete, and view details of all users.
- **Design Management:** Upload, edit, categorize, and remove clothing designs.
- **Supplier Management:** Approve/reject supplier applications, manage supplier profiles.
- **Order Management:** View, update status, and manage all customer orders.
- **Payment Management:** Track and reconcile payments.

### 3. Supplier
- **Profile Management:** Suppliers can create and update their business profiles.
- **Order Viewing:** Suppliers can view orders related to their designs and track their status.
- **Design Submission (Future):** Potentially, suppliers could submit their own designs for approval (currently managed by admin).

## User experience goals
- **Intuitive Navigation:** The website should be easy to navigate for all user roles, with clear menus and logical flows.
- **Visually Appealing:** A modern, clean, and attractive design that highlights the custom clothing.
- **Responsive:** The platform must be fully responsive and work seamlessly across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Fast Performance:** Quick loading times and smooth interactions to ensure a pleasant user experience.
- **Secure:** Users' personal and payment information must be handled with the highest security standards.
- **Clear Communication:** Provide clear feedback to users on their actions (e.g., "Item added to cart," "Order placed successfully").

## Future Considerations
- Advanced search and filtering for products.
- User reviews and ratings.
- Integration with third-party shipping services.
- Analytics and reporting.
