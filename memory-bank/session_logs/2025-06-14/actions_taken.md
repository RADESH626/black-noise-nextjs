# Actions Taken - 2025-06-14

1.  **Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`:** Removed shipping cost display and adjusted total calculation to only include subtotal.
2.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js`:** Updated `getCartByUserId` to populate `descripcion` and `categoria` fields from the `Design` model.
3.  **Modified `src/components/common/CartItem.jsx`:** Added display for `item.descripcion` and `item.categoria`.
4.  **Modified `src/components/common/CartItem.jsx`:** Added display for the subtotal of each item (`item.price * item.quantity`).
5.  **Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`:** Updated the `key` prop in the `cartItems.map` function to ensure a unique and stable key for each `CartItem`. The `map` callback now includes `index`, and the key is `item.id ? String(item.id) : `${item.name || 'unknown'}-${index}``.
6.  **Modified `src/components/common/CartItem.jsx`:** Implemented safe access to `item.price` and `item.quantity` using the nullish coalescing operator (`?? 0`) before calling `toFixed(2)` to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors.
7.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js`:** Ensured that `updateCartItemQuantity` returns the fully populated cart data, including all design details, after a quantity update. This prevents the loss of design information when the cart state is updated in the frontend.
8.  **Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`:** Implemented client-side quantity updates with debouncing. Quantity changes now update the UI instantly, and a debounced server call (`updateCartItemQuantity`) is made after a 1000ms (1 second) delay to synchronize with the backend.
9.  **Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`:** Adjusted `handleUpdateQuantity` to correctly remove an item from the client-side cart state when its quantity is set to 0.
10. **Modified `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`:**
    *   Implemented a `showLoginPrompt` state to display a user-friendly notification if an unauthenticated user attempts to add an item to the cart.
    *   Removed the 500ms debounce (`setTimeout`) from `handleAddItemToCart`, ensuring the `addDesignToCart` server action is called immediately after the optimistic UI update. This resolves the button reverting issue.
11. **Modified `src/components/catalogo/DesignCard.jsx`:** Wrapped the component with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
12. **Modified `src/components/catalogo/DesignGrid.jsx`:** Wrapped the component with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
13. **Modified `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js`:** Updated `addDesignToCart` to return the fully populated and formatted cart data (with `id` as string) after adding/updating an item, ensuring consistency with client-side expectations and resolving the issue of other designs reverting their "in cart" status.
14. **Fixed Runtime Error: "totalConEnvio is not defined"**: This error occurred in `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` because the `totalConEnvio` variable was used before being defined.
    -   **Correction:** Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` to replace `totalConEnvio` with `totalAPagar` in the `handleProceedToPayment` function, as `totalAPagar` was already correctly defined and calculated.
15. **Created `src/components/pago/PaymentModal.jsx`**: Encapsulated payment form logic into a new modal component.
16. **Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`**: Updated `handleProceedToPayment` to display `PaymentModal` using `usePopUp` instead of redirecting to `/pago`.
17. **`src/app/pago/page.jsx`**: No modifications were applied to this file, as per user's implicit feedback to keep it as a standalone page.
