## Task: Enhance cart page information and display, and fix React warnings.

### Objective:
- Display more design information (description, category), show subtotal, hide shipping cost on the `/carrito` page, and resolve the "unique key prop" warning in `CartComponent.jsx` and "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')" in `CartItem.jsx`, and ensure full design details are rendered after quantity updates. Implement client-side quantity and subtotal updates with debouncing for server synchronization.
