# Active Context - Current Session State

## Session Summary: Corrected "Module not found", `useActionState` import, and `Input` component definition errors in FormBuscarUsuario.jsx - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Date**: 9/6/2025, 8:36:50 a. m.
**Objective**: To resolve "Module not found" errors, `useActionState` import issues, and `Input` component definition errors in `src/components/layout/admin/usuarios/forms/FormBuscarUsuario.jsx` by correcting import paths and hook origins, and adding the missing `Input` component import.

### ‚úÖ Changes Implemented This Session:

* **File:** `memory-bank/funcionalidades/gestin-de-usuarios-admin.md`
    * **Change:** Added a note about the corrected import paths for `BotonGeneral`, `usePopUp`, and `FiltrarUsuarios`.
* **File:** `src/components/layout/admin/usuarios/forms/FormBuscarUsuario.jsx`
    * **Change:** Corrected the import paths for `BotonGeneral` (to `src/components/common/botones/BotonGeneral`), `usePopUp` (to `src/context/PopUpContext`), and `FiltrarUsuarios` (to `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions`). Also, corrected the import of `useActionState` from `react-dom` to `react`, and added the import for `Input` component from `src/components/common/inputs/InputGeneral`.

### üí° Key Decisions & New Patterns:
* Ensured adherence to the "Existence Verification Principle" by verifying file paths before making code changes.
* Confirmed that `@/` aliases are used for imports, which was crucial for correcting the paths.
* Applied the React 19 hook change for `useActionState` as documented in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
* Identified and resolved missing component import by checking common component directories.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps:
* No immediate next steps related to this specific task. All identified errors have been resolved.
