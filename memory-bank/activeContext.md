## Current Session: Document Email Sending Functionality (2025-06-15)

This session focused on documenting the global email sending functionality as requested by the user, ensuring future reference and adherence to documentation directives.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `memory-bank/functionalities/EmailSending.md` to document the global email sending functionality. This document details how email sending works, the files involved (`src/utils/nodemailer.js`, `src/app/acciones/ProveedorActions.js`), and how it is used.
- Updated `memory-bank/manifest.md` to include an entry for the new `EmailSending.md` documentation file under "Feature Documentation".
