### Session Change Log - 18/6/2025

**Task:** Console Error - Fix `params` access in `src\app\admin\designs\editar\[id]\page.jsx` and resolve 404 for `/admin/designs/agregar`

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/app/admin/designs/editar/[id]/page.jsx` to unwrap the `params` object using `React.use()` before accessing the `id` property.
- Added `import React from 'react';` to the same file to resolve "React is not defined" runtime error.
- Created the file `src/app/admin/designs/agregar/page.jsx` to resolve the 404 error for the `/admin/designs/agregar` route.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/admin/designs/editar/[id]/page.jsx`
- `src/app/admin/designs/agregar/page.jsx` (new file)
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated log)

**Problems Encountered:**
- Initial `replace_in_file` failed due to inexact search pattern. Corrected with a more precise pattern.
- Encountered "React is not defined" runtime error after fixing `params` access, resolved by adding `import React`.
- Encountered a 404 error for `/admin/designs/agregar`, resolved by creating the missing `page.jsx` file.

**Next Steps:**
- Log these changes in `activeContext.md`.
- Instruct user to restart the development server to apply the changes and verify the fix for the 404.
- Commit the changes.
- Implement the form and logic in `src/app/admin/designs/agregar/page.jsx` (This is a potential next task).
