# Active Context - Current Session State

## Session Summary: Visual alignment of components and layout adjustments - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Date**: 9/6/2025, 10:47:02 a.¬†m.

**Objective**: Ensure the 'proveedor', 'pedidos', 'ventas', and 'pagos' components have the same visual disposition as the 'dise√±os' component, specifically addressing redundant nav bars and gray boxes within these components.

---

### ‚úÖ Changes Implemented This Session:

* **File:** `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`
    * **Change:** Modified the display of the "Nuestros Proveedores" section to use a grid layout and styling consistent with `DesignsComponent.jsx`, including a placeholder image and a "VER DETALLES" button for each provider item. Removed the "Mi Panel de Proveedor" section to eliminate a redundant "gray box" within the component.
* **File:** `src/app/perfil/PedidosComponent.jsx`
    * **Change:** Minor adjustments to the content display within each order item to align with the `DesignsComponent.jsx`'s content section styling.
* **File:** `src/app/perfil/PagosComponent.jsx`
    * **Change:** Refactored the payment list to use a grid layout and styling consistent with `DesignsComponent.jsx`, including a placeholder image and a "VER DETALLES" button for each payment item.
* **File:** `src/components/layout/admin/dashboards/ventas/FormFiltrarVentas.jsx`
    * **Change:** Transformed the sales list from a simple `<ul>` to a grid layout with styling consistent with `DesignsComponent.jsx`, including a placeholder image and a "VER DETALLES" button for each sales item.

### üí° Key Decisions & New Patterns:

* Identified `src/components/layout/admin/dashboards/ventas/FormFiltrarVentas.jsx` as the actual component responsible for displaying sales data, rather than `VentasDashboard.jsx`.
* Used placeholder images for components that did not originally have images to maintain visual consistency with `DesignsComponent.jsx`.
* Confirmed that `DesignsComponent.jsx`, `PedidosComponent.jsx`, and `PagosComponent.jsx` are rendered within `ProfileContent.jsx`, which correctly provides the main user profile layout (including the nav bar and user info box).
* Confirmed that `FormFiltrarVentas.jsx` is rendered within `VentasDashboard.jsx`, which is then rendered within `AdminLayout.jsx`, correctly providing the admin sidebar and main content area.
* The "nav bar and gray box" elements are part of the parent layouts, not redundant elements within the list components themselves, except for the "Mi Panel de Proveedor" section in `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`, which was removed.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps:

* The task is completed.
