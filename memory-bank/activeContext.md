**Task:** Fixed an issue where saved designs were not appearing in the user's profile.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/app/acciones/DesignActions.js`.
- Corrected the field name used in the `obtenerDesignsPorUsuarioId` function from `userId` to `usuarioId` to correctly query the `Design` model.

**Reasoning:**
The `Design` model defines the user ID as `usuarioId`, but the retrieval function was incorrectly querying for `userId`. This mismatch prevented designs from being fetched and displayed in the user's profile. Updating the query to use the correct field name resolves this data retrieval issue.

**Task:** Created a new Mongoose model for the shopping cart.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `memory-bank/functionalities/Cart.md` to document the new Cart model functionality.
- Created `src/models/Cart.js` with a schema for `userId` and `designIds`.
- Updated `src/models/index.js` to import and export the new `Cart` model.

**Reasoning:**
The new `Cart` model is necessary to store the IDs of designs that a user adds to their shopping cart. This allows for persistent cart data that can be retrieved and used to display design information in the cart component within the user's profile. This approach separates cart content from design details, ensuring flexibility and up-to-date information.

### 10/6/2025, 5:47:27 p. m.

**Task:** Fixed the layout and functionality of the cart view.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/app/carrito/page.jsx` to change the main cart section's layout from `flex-row` to `flex-col`, ensuring vertical stacking of cart items and summary.
- Modified `src/components/carrito/CartSummaryAndPayment.jsx` to:
    - Remove "TU PEDIDO" header, "Cantidad de productos", "Costo de envío", and the "PAGAR AHORA" button.
    - Add "Agregar a Pedido" and "Vaciar Carrito" buttons, positioned horizontally alongside the "Total" display.
    - Adjust the component's width to `w-full` and remove `mt-20` for proper alignment.
- Modified `src/components/carrito/CartItemsList.jsx` to remove the `w-1/2` class, ensuring it takes full width within its container.
- Modified `src/app/carrito/page.jsx` to add `justify-between` to the main cart section's `section` element, pushing the `CartSummaryAndPayment` component to the bottom of the available vertical space.

**Reasoning:**
The previous cart view did not match the desired design, with the total and action buttons incorrectly positioned. These changes align the UI with the provided image, improving the user experience by presenting a clear and functional cart summary. The additional change to `CartItemsList.jsx` ensures proper horizontal alignment of the cart items section, and the `justify-between` on the main section ensures the summary is pushed to the bottom.

### 10/6/2025, 5:54:34 p. m.

**Task:** Refactored cart item display to match design card styling.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/carrito/CartItemsList.jsx` to:
    - Change its main container to a responsive grid (`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`).
    - Style individual cart items as cards (`bg-gray-800 rounded-xl shadow-lg overflow-hidden`) with an image, name, price, quantity input, and an "Eliminar" button.
    - Accept `updateQuantity` and `removeItem` functions as props from `src/app/carrito/page.jsx`.
- Modified `src/app/carrito/page.jsx` to pass `updateQuantity` and `removeItem` functions from `useCartStorage` to `CartItemsList`.

**Reasoning:**
The user requested that the cart items be displayed with a similar visual style to the design cards in the profile's "DISEÑOS" tab. This refactoring provides a consistent and improved visual experience for cart items, making them more visually appealing and functional.

### 10/6/2025, 6:29:00 p. m.

**Task:** Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')` in `getCartByUserId`.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js`.
- Added a nullish coalescing operator (`|| []`) to `cart.items.map` to ensure `map` is always called on an array, even if `cart.items` is `undefined` or `null`.

**Reasoning:**
The error occurred because `cart.items` was `undefined` when `map` was called. This fix ensures that `cart.items` defaults to an empty array if it's not defined, preventing the `TypeError` and making the `getCartByUserId` function more robust.

### 10/6/2025, 6:32:45 p. m.

**Task:** Refactored how the cart is displayed in the user profile.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `memory-bank/functionalities/Cart.md` to document the proposed refactoring of the `CartComponent`.
- Created `src/components/common/CartItem.jsx` to encapsulate the rendering of a single cart item.
- Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx` to import and utilize `CartItem.jsx` for rendering individual cart items, passing necessary props for quantity updates and item removal.

**Reasoning:**
The refactoring was performed to improve the modularity, readability, and reusability of the cart display within the user profile. By separating the rendering of individual cart items into a dedicated `CartItem` component, the `CartComponent` now has a clearer responsibility, focusing on overall cart management. This approach enhances maintainability and allows for easier future modifications to the cart item display.
