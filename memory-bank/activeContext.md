# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the memory bank for the "Black Noise Next.js E-commerce" project.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` with an overview, core goals, key features, technologies, stakeholders, and future considerations.
- Created `productContext.md` detailing the project's purpose, problems it solves, how it should work for different user roles, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
- Continue creating the remaining core memory bank files: `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Once all core files are created, the memory bank initialization will be complete.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The memory bank will serve as the primary source of truth for project context and progress.
- All significant changes, new patterns, and insights will be documented here.
- Cuando se agreguen funcionalidades, se debe añadir una forma de depuración (debug) como `console.log` para mostrar el uso de la función o el comportamiento esperado.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project structure indicates a clear separation of concerns with `src/app` for Next.js pages and API routes, `src/components` for UI components, `src/context` for React contexts, `src/models` for Mongoose models, and `src/utils` for utility functions.
- Authentication is handled via NextAuth.js, as indicated by `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` and `src/context/UserContext.jsx`.
- Database interaction is likely through Mongoose, given the presence of `src/models` and `src/utils/DBconection.js`.
- The project uses a mix of `jsx` and `js` extensions for components and API routes, suggesting a JavaScript/React environment.
- There are distinct sections for `admin` and `proveedor` (supplier) functionalities, aligning with the user roles defined in `productContext.md`.
