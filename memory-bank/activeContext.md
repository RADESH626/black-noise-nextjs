### Component Modularity Refactoring

**Summary:**
The "Component Modularity" refactoring goal has been successfully completed. This involved identifying large `page.jsx` files and breaking them down into smaller, more focused components, and moving reusable UI components from page-specific directories to `src/components/common/` or `src/components/layout/`.

**Details of Changes:**

*   **`src/app/page.jsx`**:
    *   Refactored into `HeroSection.jsx`, `DesignRealClothesSection.jsx`, `AddElementsSection.jsx`, `GarmentTypesSection.jsx`, and `SupplierRegistrationSection.jsx`.
    *   New components are located in `src/components/home/`.
*   **`src/app/carrito/page.jsx`**:
    *   Refactored into `CartLeftPanel.jsx`, `CartItemsList.jsx`, and `CartSummaryAndPayment.jsx`.
    *   New components are located in `src/components/carrito/`.
*   **`src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`**:
    *   Refactored into `CatalogTabs.jsx`, `NewPostSection.jsx`, `DesignCard.jsx`, and `DesignGrid.jsx`.
    *   New components are located in `src/components/catalogo/`.
*   **`src/app/login/page.jsx`**:
    *   Refactored into `LoginInfoSection.jsx`.
    *   New component is located in `src/components/login/`.
*   **`src/app/pago/page.jsx`**:
    *   Refactored into `OrderSummary.jsx` and `PaymentForm.jsx`.
    *   New components are located in `src/components/pago/`.
*   **Moved Reusable Components from `src/app/perfil/`**:
    *   `src/app/perfil/PedidosComponent.jsx` moved to `src/components/common/PedidosComponent.jsx`.
    *   `src/app/perfil/ProfileContent.jsx` moved to `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`.
    *   `src/app/perfil/CartComponent.jsx` moved to `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`.
    *   `src/app/perfil/DesignsComponent.jsx` moved to `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx`.
    *   `src/app/perfil/PagosComponent.jsx` moved to `src/components/common/PagosComponent.jsx`.
    *   `src/app/perfil/ProfileData.jsx` was deleted as it became redundant after `ProfileContent.jsx` was moved.

**Next Steps:**
The next refactoring goal is "Global Styles Optimization (`src/app/globals.css`)".
