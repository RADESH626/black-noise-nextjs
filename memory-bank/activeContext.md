## Current Session: Payment Modal Refactoring (2025-06-14)

This session focused on refactoring the payment modal to be local to the cart page, removing its dependency on `PopUpContext`.

**Changes Made:**
- Moved payment modal logic and UI from `src/components/pago/PaymentModal.jsx` directly into `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`.
- `src/components/pago/PaymentModal.jsx` was deleted.
- `src/app/pago/page.jsx` and its directory `src/app/pago` were deleted as they became obsolete.
- Updated `memory-bank/functionalities/GestionDePedidosYPagos.md` to reflect these changes.

## Previous Sessions:
- Hydration Error Fix (2025-06-14)
- Cart Page Enhancements and Bug Fixes (2025-06-14)
