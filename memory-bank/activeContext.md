### Task: Fix Modal Content Cutting Issue

**Problem:** The content of `ModalEditarUsuario` (specifically `FormEditarUsuario.jsx`) was being cut off, preventing access to all form fields. This was suspected to be due to an overly restrictive `max-height` calculation in the generic `Modal.jsx` component.

**Analysis:**
1.  **`Modal.jsx`**: The `div` wrapping `{children}` had `max-h-[calc(100vh-15rem)]`. The `15rem` (240px) deduction was found to be insufficient to account for all non-scrollable elements.
    *   Estimated fixed vertical space from `Modal.jsx` (paddings, title, close button, `mt-2`): ~104px.
2.  **`ModalEditarUsuario.jsx`**: This component added further fixed vertical space before `FormEditarUsuario.jsx`.
    *   Paddings (`p-6`, `p-8`): ~112px.
    *   Sticky header (`h2` with `py-2`, `mb-8`): ~48px.
    *   Total estimated fixed vertical space from `ModalEditarUsuario.jsx` within the scrollable area: `104px + 160px = 264px`.
3.  **Total Fixed Height Calculation:** Sum of fixed elements from both modals: `104px + 160px = 264px`.
    *   The original `15rem` (240px) was less than the required `264px`, leading to content cutoff.
4.  **`FormEditarUsuario.jsx`**: Confirmed no explicit height restrictions within this component.

**Solution:**
The `max-h` deduction in `Modal.jsx` was increased from `15rem` to `20rem` (320px). This provides a sufficient buffer (`320px - 264px = 56px`) to ensure all fixed elements are accounted for, allowing `FormEditarUsuario.jsx` to display fully and enable scrolling when its content exceeds the available height.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/common/modales/Modal.jsx`

**Next Steps for User:**
Please verify the solution by opening the modal and checking if the form content is fully visible and scrollable.
