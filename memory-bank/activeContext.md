### ‚úÖ Changes Implemented This Session:

* **File:** `memory-bank/funcionalidades/catlogo-de-diseos.md`
    * **Change:** Updated documentation to reflect that the "Publicar Dise√±o" section now redirects to the user's profile page (`/perfil`).
* **File:** `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`
    * **Change:** Replaced the `<button>` element for "Publicar Dise√±o" with a `Link` component from `next/link` and set its `href` to `/perfil` to enable redirection.

### üí° Key Decisions & New Patterns:
* Used `next/link` for client-side navigation to ensure a smooth transition to the profile page without a full page reload.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps:
* No immediate next steps related to this task. The functionality is implemented and documented.
