# Session Change Log

## Task: Implement notification for new orders

### Changes Made:
- Added a `console.log` statement in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` within the `guardarPedido` function to log the ID of a newly created order.

### Rationale:
- To fulfill the user's request to "ver cuando un nuevo pedido se agrego a la base de datos", a simple console log was implemented to provide immediate feedback during development when an order is successfully saved.

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Generate git commit command.
