# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on transforming the `/catalogo` view into a social media-like page, using mock design data, and ensuring proper integration with existing contexts.

## Recent Changes
- Created `src/context/MockSessionContext.jsx` to provide a mock session state.
- Created `src/components/common/SessionToggleButton.jsx` for toggling the mock session.
- Created `src/hooks/useSimulatedSession.js` to abstract session logic, prioritizing mock session.
- Modified `src/app/layout.jsx` to integrate `MockSessionProvider` and `SessionToggleButton`.
- Modified `src/app/perfil/ProfileContent.jsx` to use `useSimulatedSession` for conditional rendering based on session status.
- Modified `src/components/layout/general/HeaderPrincipal.jsx` to:
    - Use `useSimulatedSession`.
    - Conditionally render a user profile image/icon when a session exists.
    - Implement an `onClick` handler on the user icon to open a modal.
    - The modal content includes options to "Ver Perfil" and "Cerrar Sesión".
- Added a `console.log` statement to `src/context/MockSessionContext.jsx` within the `toggleMockSession` function to debug state changes.
- Created `src/context/MockDataContext.jsx` to provide a mock data state.
- Created `src/hooks/useMockData.js` to abstract mock data logic.
- Created `src/components/common/MockDataToggleButton.jsx` for toggling mock data.
- Modified `src/app/layout.jsx` to integrate `MockDataProvider` and `MockDataToggleButton`, placing the toggle buttons at the bottom right of the screen for easy access during development.
- **NEW:** Eliminated `src/context/UserContext.jsx`.
- **NEW:** Modified `src/app/layout.jsx` to remove `UserProvider` import and component.
- **NEW:** Refactored `src/components/common/modales/NewOrderModal.jsx` to:
    - Use `useSession` from `next-auth/react` instead of `useUser`.
    - Fetch detailed user data (including `_id`) using `ObtenerUsuarioPorCorreo` from `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions` based on the session email.
    - Adjust all logic and rendering that previously relied on `UserContext`.
- **NEW:** Modified `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to display designs in a social media-like format, including user avatars and interaction buttons (like, share).
- **NEW:** Integrated `mockDesigns` from `src/data/mock/designs.js` into `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to replace hardcoded design data.
- **NEW:** Changed the "Crear Publicación" button text to "Publicar Diseño" in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`.
- **NEW:** Implemented client-side like/unlike toggle functionality for designs in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` using `localStorage` to persist liked states.
- **NEW:** Resolved "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` by memoizing derived state using `useMemo`.
- **NEW:** Enhanced the like button in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to visually toggle between an outline heart (`♡`) and a filled heart (`❤️`) based on the liked state.
- **NEW:** Implemented conditional rendering in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to display a "No hay diseños disponibles" message when no designs are present.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.
- Instruct the user to restart the development server and verify the changes.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The session and data simulation contexts are retained for frontend development acceleration.
- The authentication bypass implemented across `src/middleware.js`, `src/app/layout.jsx`, and `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` is temporary and specifically for frontend development. It will need to be reverted or adjusted for production environments to re-enable authentication and authorization.
- **Critical Environmental Note:** Due to persistent caching issues with the Next.js development server, a full manual restart (`Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `npm run dev`, then `npm run dev` again) is required for the implemented changes to take effect.
- **Product Decision:** Comments are intentionally not implemented for designs to avoid potential negative opinions. This means the "Comentar" button should be removed from the UI.
- **Product Decision:** The like functionality for designs should be a toggle (like/unlike) rather than a single-click like.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Next.js middleware for route protection.
- React Context for global state management (mock session, mock data).
- Custom hooks for abstracting logic (`useSimulatedSession`, `useMockData`).
- Modals for user interaction (profile options).
- Centralizing user data fetching via NextAuth.js session and server actions.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Understanding how to configure Next.js middleware to control route access.
- How to create a mock session and data environment for isolated frontend testing.
- How to integrate modals for user-specific actions in the header.
- Debugging React Context and hook propagation issues.
- **Workflow Insight:** When a task is denied, it's often because the project is already running, and I should avoid restarting the server unless explicitly necessary.
- **Architectural Refinement:** Successfully refactored user data management to rely on NextAuth.js session and a server action, eliminating a redundant `UserContext`.
- **UI/UX Adaptation:** Adapted the `/catalogo` view to a social media-like interface while adhering to product decisions regarding feature exclusion (e.g., comments), implementing client-side like/unlike toggle with visual feedback (outline/filled heart icon), and providing a message for when no designs are available.
