### Session Change Log - 18/6/2025

**Task:** Console Error - Fix `params` access in `src\app\admin\designs\editar\[id]\page.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/app/admin/designs/editar/[id]/page.jsx` to unwrap the `params` object using `React.use()` before accessing the `id` property, resolving a Next.js console warning/error.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/admin/designs/editar/[id]/page.jsx`

**Problems Encountered:**
- None. The fix was straightforward based on the console error message.

**Next Steps:**
- Log this change in `activeContext.md`.
- Confirm the fix by running the application and navigating to the affected page. (This step is outside the scope of the current tool use but is the logical next step for verification).
