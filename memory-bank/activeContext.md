# Session Change Log

## Task: Implement notification for new orders

### Changes Made:
- Added a `console.log` statement in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` within the `guardarPedido` function to log the ID of a newly created order.

### Rationale:
- To fulfill the user's request to "ver cuando un nuevo pedido se agrego a la base de datos", a simple console log was implemented to provide immediate feedback during development when an order is successfully saved.

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Generate git commit command.

## Task: Align internal documentation with new operational directives

### Changes Made:
- Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with Cline's new operational directives, including principles, memory bank structure, project intelligence, unified workflow (with mermaid diagram), task scope definition, verification/self-correction protocol, and session logging/version control.
- Added a note to `memory-bank/project_overview.md` referencing the updated operational directives in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Added a note to `memory-bank/techContext.md` referencing the updated operational directives in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Updated the description for `systemPatterns.md` in `memory-bank/manifest.md` to reflect that it now includes Cline's operational directives.

### Rationale:
- To ensure Cline's internal documentation accurately reflects the new operating rules provided by the user, enhancing clarity and adherence to the defined workflow.

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Generate git commit command.
