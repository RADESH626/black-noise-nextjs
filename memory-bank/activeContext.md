## Task: Remove "Eres un proveedor?" section from index page and adjust footer spacing

- Removed the `SupplierRegistrationSection` component from `src/app/page.jsx`. This removes the "Eres un proveedor?" section from the home page as requested.
- Resolved a merge conflict in `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx` that was causing a build error.
- Fixed a runtime error in `src/components/common/PagosComponent.jsx` by correcting the state variable name from `paidOrders` to `pagos` and using the correct imported function `obtenerPagosPorUsuarioId`.
- Increased the spacing between sections in the footer by changing the `gap-4` class to `gap-8` in `src/components/layout/general/footer/Footer.jsx`.
