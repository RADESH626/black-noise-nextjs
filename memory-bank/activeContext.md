# Session Context and Changes

**Date:** 12/6/2025
**Time:** 6:58:51 p. m. (America/Bogota, UTC-5:00)
**Task:** Ensure the logout button redirects to the login page after closing the session.

**Analysis:**
- Checked `memory-bank/refactoring_complete.md` and confirmed refactoring is complete.
- Reviewed `memory-bank/manifest.md` to understand documentation structure.
- Listed files in `memory-bank/functionalities/` and determined a dedicated user management documentation file was needed.
- Created `memory-bank/functionalities/UserManagement.md` and added initial documentation for user management, including logout.
- Read `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js` but did not find the logout implementation there.
- Searched for logout-related terms and button elements in `src/components/` and `src/app/` directories without success.
- Read `src/app/perfil/page.jsx` and identified that it uses the `ProfileContent` component.
- Read `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` and located the logout button.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `memory-bank/functionalities/UserManagement.md` to document user management features.
- No code changes were required in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` as the logout button already uses `signOut({ callbackUrl: '/login' })`, which redirects to the login page after logout, fulfilling the user's request.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 6:59:48 p. m.
**Task:** Fix "The first argument must be one of type string, Buffer, ArrayBuffer, Array, or Array-like Object. Received type undefined" runtime error in `DesignCard.jsx`.

**Analysis:**
- Received user feedback about a runtime error in `DesignCard.jsx` related to `Buffer.from()`.
- The error occurs when `diseño.imageData.data` is `undefined`.
- Traced the data source to `obtenerDesigns` in `DesignActions.js`, which returns `imageData` as a Buffer directly, not nested in a `data` property.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/catalogo/DesignCard.jsx` to use `diseño.imageData` directly instead of `diseño.imageData.data` when creating the base64 string.

**Conclusion:** The runtime error should be resolved by correctly accessing the Buffer data.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:00:37 p. m.
**Task:** Fix "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')" runtime error in `DesignCard.jsx`.

**Analysis:**
- Received user feedback about a runtime error in `DesignCard.jsx` related to `diseño.price.toFixed()`.
- The error occurs when `diseño.price` is `undefined`.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/catalogo/DesignCard.jsx` to use optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing `diseño.price` before calling `toFixed()`.

**Conclusion:** The runtime error should be resolved by safely accessing `diseño.price`.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:01:44 p. m.
**Task:** Fix images not displaying in the design grid.

**Analysis:**
- Received user feedback that design images are not visible.
- Examined the image source logic in `DesignCard.jsx` and the data fetching in `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` and `src/app/acciones/DesignActions.js`.
- Identified that `obtenerDesigns` returns `imageData` as a Buffer, and `DesignCard.jsx` was incorrectly trying to access `diseño.imageData.data`.
- Further analysis after user feedback indicated that the `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` in `obtenerDesigns` might be causing issues with the Buffer data.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/catalogo/DesignCard.jsx` to use `diseño.imageData` directly when creating the base64 string.
- Modified `src/app/acciones/DesignActions.js` to manually convert the `imageData` Buffer to a base64 string in the `obtenerDesigns` function before returning the data.

**Conclusion:** The images should now display correctly by ensuring the image data is consistently a base64 string when it reaches the component.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:04:52 p. m.
**Task:** Re-apply fix for "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')" runtime error in `DesignCard.jsx`.

**Analysis:**
- Received user feedback that the `toFixed()` error reappeared.
- Assumed the previous fix was lost due to task interruption.

**Changes Made:**
- Re-applied the modification to `src/components/catalogo/DesignCard.jsx` to use optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing `diseño.price`.

**Conclusion:** The runtime error related to `toFixed()` should now be resolved again.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:05:41 p. m.
**Task:** Correct image source handling in `DesignCard.jsx` after modifying `obtenerDesigns` to return base64 strings.

**Analysis:**
- User denied completion, indicating ongoing issues, likely image display.
- Realized that after changing `obtenerDesigns` to return base64 strings, `DesignCard.jsx` was still attempting `Buffer.from()` on the already base64 string.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/catalogo/DesignCard.jsx` to directly use `diseño.imageData` (the base64 string) in the image source URL.

**Conclusion:** The image source handling in `DesignCard.jsx` now correctly uses the base64 string provided by `obtenerDesigns`.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:07:31 p. m.
**Task:** Address client-side exception error.

**Analysis:**
- Received user feedback about a general client-side exception.
- Suspected issues with `Buffer` usage on the client side after recent changes.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/catalogo/DesignCard.jsx` to remove the unnecessary `Buffer.from()` call, the unused `React` import, and the incorrect `key` prop on the root element.

**Conclusion:** Removed potential sources of client-side errors related to `Buffer` and cleaned up the component.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:12:29 p. m.
**Task:** Add a button on the profile page linking to the community designs page.

**Analysis:**
- User requested a button on the profile page (`/perfil`) to navigate to the community designs page (`/catalogo`).
- Identified `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` as the location for the button.
- Determined that `next/link` should be used for navigation.

**Changes Made:**
- Imported `Link` from `next/link` in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`.
- Added a `Link` component wrapping a `BotonGeneral` with the text "VER DISEÑOS DE LA COMUNIDAD" and `href="/catalogo"` alongside existing profile buttons.

**Conclusion:** A button linking to the community designs page has been added to the profile page.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:18:31 p. m.
**Task:** Ensure the option to add new designs remains visible on the profile page.

**Analysis:**
- User requested that the "Add New Designs" option remain visible on the profile page.
- Identified that the button was only visible when the user had no designs.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` to move the "Add Design" button outside the conditional rendering block based on `userDesigns.length`.

**Conclusion:** The "Add Design" button is now always visible within the "DISEÑOS" tab on the profile page.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:36:19 p. m.
**Task:** Link the header cart button to the profile's cart section.

**Analysis:**
- User requested that the shopping cart button in the header link to the cart section within the profile page (`/perfil`).
- Identified `src/components/layout/general/HeaderPrincipal.jsx` as the location of the button.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/layout/general/HeaderPrincipal.jsx` to change the `href` of the shopping cart `Link` component from `/carrito` to `/perfil`.

**Conclusion:** The header cart button now links to the profile page.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:42:17 p. m.
**Task:** Add a purchase history to the "Pagos" section of the profile page.

**Analysis:**
- User requested that the "Pagos" section display a history of purchases (paid orders).
- Identified `src/components/common/PagosComponent.jsx` as the relevant component.
- Identified `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` as containing order fetching logic.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `obtenerPedidosPagadosPorUsuarioId` function in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` to fetch orders with `estadoPago: 'PAGADO'`.
- Modified `src/components/common/PagosComponent.jsx` to use `obtenerPedidosPagadosPorUsuarioId` and display the fetched paid orders, including item details.
- Updated `memory-bank/functionalities/GestionDePedidosYPagos.md` to document the purchase history in `PagosComponent.jsx` and the new function.

**Conclusion:** The "Pagos" section now displays a purchase history based on paid orders.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:48:59 p. m.
**Task:** Allow repurchasing of previously bought items in the designs list.

**Analysis:**
- User requested the ability to repurchase items from the designs list.
- Identified that the "Add to Cart" button in `DesignsComponent.jsx` was disabled for items in past orders.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx` to remove the check that disabled the "Add to Cart" button based on `orderedDesignIds`.
- Corrected the `getImageSrc` helper function in `DesignsComponent.jsx` to correctly handle base64 image data.
- Updated `memory-bank/functionalities/DesignImageManagement.md` to document this change in button behavior.

**Conclusion:** Previously purchased items can now be repurchased from the designs list.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 7:57:31 p. m.
**Task:** Fix "use client" directive build error in `DesignsComponent.jsx`.

**Analysis:**
- Received user feedback about a build error due to the incorrect placement of the `"use client"` directive.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx` to move the `"use client"` directive to the top of the file and remove a duplicate import.

**Conclusion:** The build error related to the `"use client"` directive should be resolved.

**Date:** 12/6/25, 8:01:52 p. m.
**Task:** Ensure items become available for purchase again after a purchase is made in the cart.

**Analysis:**
- User requested that items in the cart become available for repurchase in the designs list after a successful purchase.
- Identified that the cart needs to be cleared on the backend after payment and the frontend cart state needs to be refreshed.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `procesarPagoDePedido` in `src/app/acciones/PagoActions.js` to call `clearUserCart` after successful payment.
- Modified `ProfileContent.jsx` and `PedidosComponent.jsx` to pass and use an `onPaymentSuccess` callback to refetch cart data after the payment modal closes successfully.
- Modified `PaymentModal.jsx` to accept and call the `onPaymentSuccess` callback after successful payment.
- Updated `memory-bank/functionalities/GestionDePedidosYPagos.md` and `memory-bank/functionalities/Cart.md` to document the cart clearing after purchase.

**Conclusion:** Items in the cart should now become available for repurchase in the designs list after a successful purchase.

### Task: Fix Modal Content Cutting Issue

**Problem:** The content of `ModalEditarUsuario` (specifically `FormEditarUsuario.jsx`) was being cut off, preventing access to all form fields. This was suspected to be due to an overly restrictive `max-height` calculation in the generic `Modal.jsx` component.

**Analysis:**
1.  **`Modal.jsx`**: The `div` wrapping `{children}` had `max-h-[calc(100vh-15rem)]`. The `15rem` (240px) deduction was found to be insufficient to account for all non-scrollable elements.
    *   Estimated fixed vertical space from `Modal.jsx` (paddings, title, close button, `mt-2`): ~104px.
2.  **`ModalEditarUsuario.jsx`**: This component added further fixed vertical space before `FormEditarUsuario.jsx`.
    *   Paddings (`p-6`, `p-8`): ~112px.
    *   Sticky header (`h2` with `py-2`, `mb-8`): ~48px.
    *   Total estimated fixed vertical space from `ModalEditarUsuario.jsx` within the scrollable area: `104px + 160px = 264px`.
3.  **Total Fixed Height Calculation:** Sum of fixed elements from both modals: `104px + 160px = 264px`.
    *   The original `15rem` (240px) was less than the required `264px`, leading to content cutoff.
4.  **`FormEditarUsuario.jsx`**: Confirmed no explicit height restrictions within this component.

**Solution:**
The `max-h` deduction in `Modal.jsx` was increased from `15rem` to `20rem` (320px). This provides a sufficient buffer (`320px - 264px = 56px`) to ensure all fixed elements are accounted for, allowing `FormEditarUsuario.jsx` to display fully and enable scrolling when its content exceeds the available height.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/common/modales/Modal.jsx`

**Next Steps for User:**
Please verify the solution by opening the modal and checking if the form content is fully visible and scrollable.

### Task: Create new remote branch "re-imagine"

**Action:** Created a new local branch named `re-imagine` and pushed it to the remote repository.

**Files Modified:**
- None (branch creation is a Git operation)

**Next Steps for User:**
The branch `re-imagine` has been created remotely. You can now switch to this branch and begin working on it.

### Task: Fix `Buffer.from` undefined data error in `DesignsComponent.jsx`

**Problem:** An error occurred in `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx` on line 24, where `Buffer.from(design.imageData.data)` was called with `design.imageData.data` being `undefined`. This resulted in the error: "The first argument must be one of type string, Buffer, ArrayBuffer, Array, or Array-like Object. Received type undefined".

**Analysis:**
The `img` `src` attribute was attempting to construct a base64 image string using `design.imageData.data` without a sufficient check for its existence. While `design.imageData` was checked, `design.imageData.data` was not, leading to the `undefined` value being passed to `Buffer.from()`.

**Solution:**
Modified line 24 in `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx` to include optional chaining (`?.`) for `design.imageData.data`. This ensures that `design.imageData.data` is safely accessed and only passed to `Buffer.from()` if it is a defined value.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx`

**Next Steps for User:**
The fix has been applied. The application should no longer encounter the `Buffer.from` error when rendering designs. You can verify this by navigating to the page where `DesignsComponent` is used (e.g., `/perfil` or `/catalogo`) and checking if the images load correctly.
