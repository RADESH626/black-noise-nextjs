## Current Session: Cart Icon and Modal Implementation

### Date: 2025-06-14

### Task: Implement a cart icon in the header with a modal preview and reintroduce the /carrito page.

### Details:
- **Objective:** Add a shopping cart icon to the `HeaderPrincipal.jsx` component. When clicked, a modal should appear displaying items in the cart (image, name, price, quantity) with a button to navigate to `/carrito`. If the cart is empty, a message should indicate that. The `/carrito` page has been reintroduced as a dedicated page.

### Actions Taken:
1.  **Updated `memory-bank/functionalities/Cart.md`:** Modified the documentation to reflect the reintroduction of the dedicated `/carrito` page and the new cart preview modal functionality.
2.  **Created `src/components/carrito/CartModal.jsx`:** Implemented a new React component for the cart preview modal, responsible for displaying cart items, an empty cart message, and a link to the full cart page.
3.  **Modified `src/components/layout/general/HeaderPrincipal.jsx`:**
    *   Added the cart icon (`public/icons/icono-carrito.svg`).
    *   Implemented state (`showCartModal`, `cartItems`) to manage modal visibility and cart data.
    *   Added an `onClick` handler to the cart icon to fetch cart data (using `getCartByUserId`) and toggle the modal.
    *   Conditionally rendered the `CartModal` component.
    *   Corrected import paths to use aliases (`@/components/carrito/CartModal`, `@/app/acciones/CartActions`, etc.).
4.  **Created `src/app/carrito/page.jsx`:** Reintroduced the dedicated cart page, rendering the `CartComponent` (from `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`) to provide the full cart view. Corrected import path to use alias.
5.  **Updated `.clinerules`**: Added a new directive to always use path aliases for imports.
6.  **Modified `src/components/carrito/CartModal.jsx`**: Adjusted the background opacity of the modal to `bg-opacity-30` for more transparency.

### Problems Encountered:
-   Initial JSX syntax errors in `CartModal.jsx` due to incorrect escaping of angle brackets, which were subsequently corrected.
-   Repeated `Protocol error (Page.captureScreenshot): Not attached to an active page` errors when attempting to launch the browser for verification, preventing visual confirmation of changes.
-   Discrepancy between initial `Cart.md` documentation (stating `/carrito` was removed) and user's request (to reintroduce it), which was clarified with the user.
-   `Module not found` errors due to incorrect relative import paths, which were corrected to use alias imports as per new `.clinerules` directive.
-   User reported modal appearing but with a black background, which was addressed by adjusting opacity.

### Next Steps:
-   Finalize the task by updating `progress.md` and generating git commands.
