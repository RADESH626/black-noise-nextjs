**Task:** Resolved "Module not found" error for `PedidosComponent` in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated the import path for `PedidosComponent` in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` from `./PedidosComponent` to `../common/PedidosComponent`. This was necessary because `PedidosComponent.jsx` was moved to `src/components/common/` during a previous refactoring step, as noted in `refactoring_plan.md`.

**Reasoning:**
The error message indicated that `PedidosComponent` could not be resolved. By checking the `refactoring_plan.md` and listing the contents of `src/components/common/`, it was confirmed that `PedidosComponent.jsx` resides in `src/components/common/`. Adjusting the import path accordingly resolved the module resolution issue.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify the fix by running the application (if applicable).
- Continue with any remaining refactoring tasks or new user requests.
