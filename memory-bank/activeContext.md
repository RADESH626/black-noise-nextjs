# Active Context

## Session Summary: 2025-09-06

### Problem Addressed:
The modal form for adding a new provider was closing too quickly, preventing the user from seeing the generated access key.

### Changes Made:

1.  **Modified `src/components/layout/admin/dashboards/proveedores/FormularioAgregarProveedor.jsx`**:
    *   Updated the `useEffect` hook to conditionally call the `onSuccess` prop. If `state.success` is true and `state.accessKey` is present, `onSuccess` is *not* called immediately. This keeps the modal open.
    *   Introduced a `handleCloseModal` function that calls `onSuccess` and clears the `displayedAccessKey` state.
    *   Modified the form's submit button rendering:
        *   If `displayedAccessKey` is present, a "Cerrar" button is shown, allowing the user to manually close the modal after viewing the key.
        *   Otherwise, the standard "Agregar Proveedor" submit button is shown.

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/layout/admin/dashboards/proveedores/FormularioAgregarProveedor.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Generate `git add` command.
- Generate `git commit` command after user confirmation.

## Session Summary: 2025-09-06 (Problem with Supplier List)

### Problem Addressed:
The user reported a problem with the supplier list on the administrator page.

### Analysis Performed:
1.  Reviewed `memory-bank/improvement_log.md` for mandatory rules.
2.  Reviewed `memory-bank/project_overview.md`, `memory-bank/techContext.md`, `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`, and `memory-bank/funcionalidades/gestin-de-proveedores-admin.md` to understand project context and supplier management functionality.
3.  Inspected `src/models/Proveedor.js` to verify schema and field names (`metodosPagoAceptados`, `accessKey`).
4.  Inspected `src/app/acciones/ProveedorActions.js`, specifically `obtenerProveedoresHabilitados`, to check data fetching and object conversion.
5.  Inspected `src/components/layout/admin/dashboards/proveedores/ListaProveedores.jsx` to check data handling, filtering logic, and rendering.
6.  Verified `src/models/enums/pago/MetodoPago.js` enum values.

### Resolution:
The user reported that the problem was resolved by them, so no code changes were made by the model.

### Files Modified:
- None

### Next Steps:
- Generate `git add` command.
- Generate `git commit` command after user confirmation.

## Session Summary: 2025-09-06 (Module Not Found Error in Proveedor Page)

### Problem Addressed:
Resolved "Module not found" errors in `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` caused by what appeared to be malformed import paths (e.g., `''components/common/LoadingSpinner''` instead of `'@/components/common/LoadingSpinner'`). Although the file content read by the model showed correct paths, the compiler error indicated an issue with the string literal itself.

### Changes Made:
1.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`**:
    *   Replaced the existing import statements for `LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`, `BotonGeneral`, and `obtenerMiPerfilProveedor` with identical lines to force a re-evaluation by the compiler and ensure correct string literal formatting.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Generate `git add` command.
- Generate `git commit` command after user confirmation.

## Session Summary: 2025-09-06 (Documentation Update for Module Not Found Error)

### Problem Addressed:
Documented the "Module Not Found" error encountered in `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` and its resolution in `improvement_log.md` as per user request.

### Changes Made:
1.  **Modified `memory-bank/improvement_log.md`**:
    *   Added a new entry detailing the "Next.js Module Not Found (Malformed Import String Literal)" error, its symptoms, and the solution (re-saving the file via a no-op `replace_in_file` to force compiler re-evaluation).

### Files Modified:
- `memory-bank/improvement_log.md`

### Next Steps:
- Generate `git add` command.
- Generate `git commit` command after user confirmation.
