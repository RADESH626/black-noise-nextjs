### Task: Fix Syntax Error and Refactor `DesignActions.js` and `DesignsComponent.jsx`

**Date:** 10/6/2025

**Changes Made:**
- **File:** `src/app/acciones/DesignActions.js`
  - Fixed a syntax error by adding a missing comma in the `data` object definition within the `guardarDesigns` function.
  - Removed duplicate image handling logic within `guardarDesigns` function.
  - Removed duplicate properties (`nombreDesing`, `valorDesing`, `imagenDesing`, `estadoDesing`, `coloresDisponibles`, `tallasDisponibles`) in the `data` object within the `guardarDesigns` function.
  - Removed duplicate properties (`coloresDisponibles`, `tallasDisponibles`) in the `data` object within the `actualizarDesign` function.
- **File:** `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx`
  - Added a nullish coalescing operator to `cartItems` to ensure it's an array before calling `.some()`, preventing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'some')`.

**Reasoning for Changes:**
- The initial error in `DesignActions.js` was a syntax error due to a missing comma, which was resolved.
- Duplicate code blocks and object properties were identified, leading to re-declaration errors and unnecessary redundancy. These were refactored to improve code readability, maintainability, and prevent potential bugs.
- The `TypeError` in `DesignsComponent.jsx` was due to `cartItems` being `undefined` when `.some()` was called. The fix ensures `cartItems` defaults to an empty array, making the component more robust.

**Next Steps:**
- Generate a commit message for these changes.
- Confirm the resolution of the original error.
