# Active Context - Current Session State

## Session Summary: Adapted PedidosComponent.jsx to match DesignsComponent.jsx visual style and resolved JSX comment errors - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Date**: 9/6/2025, 9:00:42 a. m.
**Objective**: Adapt the visual presentation of the "pedidos" section in the user profile to be similar to the "dise√±os" section and resolve persistent TypeScript errors related to JSX comments.

---

### ‚úÖ Changes Implemented This Session:

*   **File:** `memory-bank/funcionalidades/gestin-de-perfil-de-usuario.md`
    *   **Change:** Added a note about the visual adaptation of `PedidosComponent.jsx` to align with `DesignsComponent.jsx`.
*   **File:** `src/app/perfil/PedidosComponent.jsx`
    *   **Change:** Refactored the component to use a card-based grid layout similar to `DesignsComponent.jsx`, including standardized styling, image placeholders, and a "VER DETALLES" button for each order item. Removed problematic JSX comments that were causing TypeScript errors.

### üí° Key Decisions & New Patterns:

*   Standardized the visual presentation of individual items within `PedidosComponent.jsx` to match the card-based grid layout of `DesignsComponent.jsx`.
*   Used `write_to_file` as a fallback due to persistent `replace_in_file` matching issues.
*   Resolved persistent TypeScript errors by removing problematic JSX comments, indicating a potential linter/parser sensitivity to comments in specific positions.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps:

*   Generate and present `git add` and `git commit` commands.
