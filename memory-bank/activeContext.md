## Task: Fix user profile edit form not displaying

### Changes Made:

1.  **Corrected `useActionState` import in `src/components/perfil/FormEditarUsuario.jsx`**:
    *   **Reasoning**: The `systemPatterns.md` indicated that `useActionState` should be imported from `react`, not `react-dom`. This was a potential cause for rendering issues, especially with newer React versions.
    *   **Details**: Changed `import { useActionState, useFormStatus } from "react-dom";` to `import { useActionState } from "react"; import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";`.

2.  **Integrated `FormEditarUsuario` into modal in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`**:
    *   **Reasoning**: The user clarified that the edit form is intended to be displayed within a modal, not as a standalone page. The `handleEditProfile` function in `ProfileContent.jsx` was rendering a placeholder message instead of the actual form.
    *   **Details**:
        *   Imported `FormEditarUsuario` from `@/components/perfil/FormEditarUsuario`.
        *   Modified the `handleEditProfile` function to open the modal with `FormEditarUsuario` component, passing `currentUser` as `userData` and `session.user.id` as `userId`.
        *   Implemented an `onSuccess` callback for `FormEditarUsuario` to display a success message in a new modal and re-fetch user data to update the displayed profile information.

3.  **Resolved persistent "Module not found" errors by re-parsing import paths**:
    *   **Reasoning**: The compiler was reporting malformed import string literals (e.g., `''components/common/BotonGeneral''`) despite correct paths in the source code, even after a no-op `replace_in_file`. This suggested a deeper parsing issue.
    *   **Details**: Applied a two-step `replace_in_file` operation to all problematic import lines in both `src/components/perfil/FormEditarUsuario.jsx` and `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`. This involved first changing single quotes to double quotes, and then changing them back to single quotes, to force the Next.js compiler to correctly re-parse the import string literals.

### Files Modified:

*   `src/components/perfil/FormEditarUsuario.jsx`
*   `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`
*   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (this file)

### Next Steps:

*   Present `git add` command to the user.
*   Present `git commit` command to the user after user confirmation.
