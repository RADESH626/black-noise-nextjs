## Session Summary: Corrected user data fetching logic in ProfileContent.jsx - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Date**: 9/6/2025, 9:05:07 a. m.
**Objective**: Resolve the issue of user profile information not displaying by correcting the data fetching and state update logic in `ProfileContent.jsx`.

---

### ‚úÖ Changes Implemented This Session:

*   **File:** `src/app/perfil/ProfileContent.jsx`
    *   **Change:** Corrected the destructuring of the `ObtenerUsuarioPorId` Server Action result. Previously, it was incorrectly destructuring `user` and `error` properties, while the function directly returns the user object or an error object. The `useEffect` now correctly assigns the fetched user data to `currentUser` and handles potential errors.
*   **File:** `memory-bank/funcionalidades/gestin-de-perfil-de-usuario.md`
    *   **Change:** Updated documentation to reflect that `ProfileContent.jsx` now fetches and displays full user data, including a more detailed list of displayed fields.

### üí° Key Decisions & New Patterns:

*   Identified a critical error in how the `ObtenerUsuarioPorId` Server Action's return value was being handled in `ProfileContent.jsx`, leading to `currentUser` not being populated correctly.
*   Corrected the data assignment to ensure the full user profile is available for rendering.
*   Expanded the displayed user information to include all standard user model fields for better visibility and debugging.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps:

*   Generate and present `git add` and `git commit` commands.
