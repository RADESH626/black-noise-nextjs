## Current Session: Remove Email API Route, Centralize Email Sending, and Self-Correction on Git Commands (2025-06-15)

This session focused on removing the dedicated API route for email sending, ensuring all email operations are handled directly through the centralized Nodemailer utility, and a critical self-correction regarding Git command execution on Windows.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `src/app/api/email/route.js` to import and use the `transporter` instance exported from `src/utils/nodemailer.js`, centralizing the email configuration.
- Deleted `src/app/api/email/route.js` as it is no longer needed, and no other files were found to be calling this API endpoint.
- Deleted the `src/app/api/email/` directory as it became empty after the `route.js` file was removed.
- **Self-Correction**: Updated `memory-bank/improvement_log.md` to critically reinforce the directive against chaining `git add` and `git commit` commands with `&&` on Windows, following a previous error. This emphasizes the need to execute them as separate commands.
