# Active Context - Current Session State

## Session Summary: Visual alignment of components - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Date**: 9/6/2025, 10:43:20 a.¬†m.

**Objective**: Ensure the 'proveedor', 'pedidos', 'ventas', and 'pagos' components have the same visual disposition as the 'dise√±os' component.

---

### ‚úÖ Changes Implemented This Session:

* **File:** `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`
    * **Change:** Modified the display of the "Nuestros Proveedores" section to use a grid layout and styling consistent with `DesignsComponent.jsx`, including a placeholder image and a "VER DETALLES" button for each provider item.
* **File:** `src/app/perfil/PedidosComponent.jsx`
    * **Change:** Minor adjustments to the content display within each order item to align with the `DesignsComponent.jsx`'s content section styling.
* **File:** `src/app/perfil/PagosComponent.jsx`
    * **Change:** Refactored the payment list to use a grid layout and styling consistent with `DesignsComponent.jsx`, including a placeholder image and a "VER DETALLES" button for each payment item.
* **File:** `src/components/layout/admin/dashboards/ventas/FormFiltrarVentas.jsx`
    * **Change:** Transformed the sales list from a simple `<ul>` to a grid layout with styling consistent with `DesignsComponent.jsx`, including a placeholder image and a "VER DETALLES" button for each sales item.

### üí° Key Decisions & New Patterns:

* Identified `src/components/layout/admin/dashboards/ventas/FormFiltrarVentas.jsx` as the actual component responsible for displaying sales data, rather than `VentasDashboard.jsx`.
* Used placeholder images for components that did not originally have images to maintain visual consistency with `DesignsComponent.jsx`.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps:

* The task is completed.
