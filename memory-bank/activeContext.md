### Task: Resolved "Module not found" error for DesignsComponent

### Changes Made:
- Corrected the import path for `DesignsComponent` in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` from `./DesignsComponent` to `../common/DesignsComponent`.

### Reason for Changes:
The `DesignsComponent.jsx` file was moved from `src/app/perfil/` to `src/components/common/` as part of the "Component Modularity" refactoring goal, but the import path in `ProfileContent.jsx` was not updated accordingly, leading to a "Module not found" error.

### Next Steps:
- Generate a git commit command.
