## Task: Add "add to cart" button to designs in user profile

### Problem:
The user requested to add an "add to cart" button to the designs displayed on their profile page, similar to the functionality available on the catalog page. An initial attempt resulted in an "addItem is not a function" error.

### Analysis:
- The `DesignsComponent` (src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx) already contains the logic for an "Agregar al carrito" button, which is conditionally rendered based on the `mode` prop (`catalog` or `profile`).
- The `ProfileContent` component (src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx) is responsible for rendering `DesignsComponent` on the user's profile page and passes the `mode="profile"` prop.
- The `CartContext` (src/context/CartContext.jsx) provides the `cartItems` and `addItem` function necessary for cart operations.
- **Correction Analysis:** The `addItem` function was not correctly implemented in `src/context/CartContext.jsx` to call the existing server action. It was attempting to call `addToCart` (aliased as `addToCartAction`) which did not exist, instead of the correctly named `addDesignToCart` function in `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js`.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx`**:
    *   Extended the conditional rendering for the "Agregar al carrito" button to include `mode === 'profile'`. This ensures the button appears on profile designs.
    *   The button's logic (checking if the item is already in the cart and calling `addItem`) remains consistent with the catalog mode.
2.  **Modified `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`**:
    *   Imported `useCart` from `@/context/CartContext`.
    *   Used the `useCart` hook to destructure `cartItems` and `addItem`.
    *   Passed `cartItems` and `addItem` as props to the `DesignsComponent` when it is rendered in the profile tab.
3.  **Modified `src/context/CartContext.jsx` (Correction)**:
    *   Corrected the import of the cart action from `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js` to use `addDesignToCart` directly, instead of an incorrect alias.
    *   Updated the `addItem` function to correctly call the `addDesignToCart` server action, passing the `userId` and the `item` (design) data.

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/common/DesignsComponent.jsx`
- `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`
- `src/context/CartContext.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Add remove button to cart modal

### Problem:
The user requested a button on each design in the cart modal to allow them to remove that design from their cart.

### Analysis:
- The `CartModal.jsx` component displays the cart items.
- The `CartContext.jsx` manages the cart state and provides functions to interact with the cart.
- The `CartActions.js` server actions handle backend cart operations.
- A `removeDesignFromCart` action already existed in `CartActions.js`.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/components/carrito/CartModal.jsx`**:
    *   Added an `onRemoveItem` prop to the component.
    *   Included a button with a trash can icon (using `icono-basurero.svg`) within each cart item's `<li>` element.
    *   The button's `onClick` handler calls `onRemoveItem(item.designId)`.
2.  **Modified `src/context/CartContext.jsx`**:
    *   Imported `removeDesignFromCart` from `src/app/acciones/CartActions.js`.
    *   Implemented a `removeItem` function that calls `removeDesignFromCart` with the `userId` and `designId`, then updates the cart state.
    *   Added `removeItem` to the `value` object provided by the `CartContext.Provider`.
3.  **Modified `src/components/layout/general/HeaderPrincipal.jsx`**:
    *   Destructured `removeItem` from the `useCart()` hook.
    *   Passed the `removeItem` function as the `onRemoveItem` prop to the `CartModal` component.

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/carrito/CartModal.jsx`
- `src/context/CartContext.jsx`
- `src/components/layout/general/HeaderPrincipal.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Add main header to user profile page

### Problem:
The user requested to add the main header to the user profile page (`/perfil`).

### Analysis:
- The `src/app/perfil/page.jsx` component was identified as the target.
- The `PageLayout` component (`src/components/layout/PageLayout.jsx`) was found to contain the `HeaderPrincipal` component, which is the main header.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/perfil/page.jsx`**:
    *   Imported `PageLayout` from `@/components/layout/PageLayout`.
    *   Wrapped the `ProfileContent` component with `PageLayout` to include the main header and footer.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/perfil/page.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Fix supplier dashboard redirection

### Problem:
When a supplier logs in, they are not redirected to their specific dashboard (`/proveedor/pedidos`) but instead to `/catalogo`, and then potentially to `/proveedor` by middleware, and then finally redirected back to `/login`. The issue persisted even after initial fixes and client-side redirect disabling. Additionally, an error "Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components" was encountered when fetching orders.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Redirection Issue:** `src/components/layout/general/forms/FormLogin.jsx` handles client-side redirection based on `state.data.userRole` returned by `loginAction`. `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js` (`loginAction` function) was authenticating suppliers but not explicitly setting `userRole: 'PROVEVEEDOR'` in the returned `data` object. This caused `FormLogin` to default to `/catalogo` for suppliers.
- **Subsequent Redirection to Login (Root Cause):** The `authorize` callback in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` was authenticating suppliers through the `Usuario` model path first. If a `Usuario` with `rol: PROVEEDOR` is found, the `authorize` callback would return an object with `isSupplier: false` (hardcoded for the `Usuario` path), even though the `Proveedor` specific authentication path (which sets `isSupplier: true`) was not reached. This `isSupplier: false` was then propagated to the client-side session, causing the redirect from `/proveedor/pedidos`.
- **"Only plain objects" Error:** The `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` server action in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` was returning Mongoose documents (or objects with `ObjectId` buffers) that were not fully converted to plain JavaScript objects, causing an error when passed to the client-side `ListaPedidosProveedorPage`.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js`**: In the `loginAction` function, added `userRole: 'PROVEVEEDOR'` to the `data` object returned upon successful supplier authentication.
2.  **Modified `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`**:
    *   In the `authorize` callback, changed `rol: null` to `rol: Rol.PROVEEDOR` for authenticated suppliers.
    *   Refactored the `authorize` callback to correctly handle users with `rol: PROVEEDOR`: If a `Usuario` with `rol: PROVEEDOR` is authenticated, it now explicitly fetches the associated `Proveedor` document and sets `isSupplier: true` and `proveedorId` in the session object returned by `authorize`. This ensures `isSupplier` is correctly `true` for suppliers.
3.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`**: Applied `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to the data returned by `guardarPedido` and `toPlainObject` to the data returned from `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` to ensure all Mongoose documents and `ObjectId`s are converted to plain JavaScript objects with string IDs before being passed to client components.
4.  **Reverted temporary debugging changes**: All temporary changes in `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` and `src/middleware.js` have been reverted.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js`
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`
- `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`
- `src/middleware.js` (reverted to original state)
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` (reverted to original state)

### Next Steps:
- Verify the fix by logging in as a supplier.
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Implement custom header for supplier view

### Problem:
The user requested a custom header for the supplier view (`/proveedor/pedidos`) instead of the general `HeaderPrincipal`. This new header should display the app title on the left and the logged-in supplier's name, and now also include a logout button, using the general button component, with black text.

### Analysis:
- The previous `HeaderPrincipal` component was removed from `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`.
- A new component, `HeaderProveedor.jsx`, was created in `src/components/layout/proveedor/`.
- This new component will use `next-auth/react` to access the session and display the supplier's name and a logout button.
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` will then import and render `HeaderProveedor`.
- The logout button needs to use the `BotonGeneral` component from `src/components/common/botones/`, and its text color should be black.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Reverted `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**: Removed the `HeaderPrincipal` import and component rendering.
2.  **Created `src/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor.jsx`**:
    *   Implemented a new React component that imports `useSession`, `signOut`, `Link`, and `BotonGeneral`.
    *   Displays "Black Noise" as the app title on the left.
    *   Conditionally displays "Bienvenido, {session.user.name}" if the session and user name are available.
    *   Added a "Cerrar Sesi√≥n" button using the `BotonGeneral` component that calls `signOut({ callbackUrl: '/login' })` on click.
    *   Styled with Tailwind CSS for basic layout, ensuring the logout button has `text-black`.
3.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**:
    *   Imported `HeaderProveedor` from `@/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor`.
    *   Rendered the `<HeaderProveedor />` component at the top of both `return` statements to ensure it's always present.
    *   Ensured the content of the `return` statements is wrapped in `Fragment` (`<>...</>`) tags to allow multiple top-level elements.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`
- `src/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor.jsx`

### Git Commit:
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "feat: Implement custom header for supplier view and fix supplier redirection"`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Fix React Hooks order in ListaPedidosProveedorPage

### Problem:
React detected a change in the order of Hooks called by `ListaPedidosProveedorPage`, specifically a `useContext` hook being `undefined` in the previous render but present in the next render. This leads to bugs and errors if not fixed, violating React's Rules of Hooks.

### Analysis:
- The `useQuery` hook was being called conditionally after `if (status === "loading")` and `if (!session || ...)` blocks.
- React Hooks must be called unconditionally at the top level of the component to ensure their order remains consistent across renders.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**: Moved the `useQuery` hook call to the top of the `ListaPedidosProveedorPage` component, before any conditional `return` statements. This ensures that `useQuery` is always called in the same order on every render, regardless of the session status or user authentication.
2.  **Refined `useQuery` in `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**: Added a conditional check `if (!session?.user?.proveedorId)` inside the `queryFn` of `useQuery` to ensure `session.user.proveedorId` is available before attempting to fetch data. This prevents errors when `session` or `session.user` might be `null` or `undefined` during initial renders, even with the `enabled` flag.
3.  **Reordered Conditional Returns in `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**: Moved the `if (status === "loading")` and `if (!session || !session.user || !session.user.isSupplier)` conditional return statements to appear *after* all React Hooks (`useSession`, `useRouter`, `useQuery`) have been called. This guarantees that all Hooks are executed unconditionally and in the same order on every render, fully adhering to React's Rules of Hooks and resolving the "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Prevent unnecessary page refresh on supplier page re-entry and flickering

### Problem:
The supplier page (`/proveedor`) was fully refreshing (re-fetching data and showing a loading spinner) every time the user navigated away and then returned to it, and also "flickered" when switching tabs.

### Analysis:
- The `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` component is a Client Component.
- It uses a `useEffect` hook to fetch supplier profile data (`obtenerMiPerfilProveedor`).
- The `useEffect` was configured to re-run the data fetch whenever its dependencies (`session`, `status`, `router`) changed, which happens on component remount or session state updates, leading to unnecessary re-fetching and display of the loading spinner.
- The "flickering" was caused by the `LoadingSpinner` being displayed even when `miPerfil` data was already present, due to `useSession` revalidating the session and briefly setting `loading` to true, and potentially by delayed authentication checks.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` (Initial Fetch Optimization)**: Adjusted the `useEffect` hook to include a condition (`!miPerfil`) before calling `fetchMiPerfil`. This ensures that the data is only fetched if `miPerfil` is `null` or `undefined`, preventing redundant data loading when the user returns to the page and the profile data is already present.
2.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` (Loading State Refinement & Flicker Fix)**:
    *   Initialized the `loading` state based on `useSession`'s initial `status` (`useState(status === "loading")`).
    *   Ensured `setLoading(true)` when `status` is "loading" inside `useEffect`.
    *   Added `miPerfil` to `useEffect` dependencies to react to its changes.
    *   Explicitly set `setLoading(false)` if `miPerfil` is already loaded and session is authenticated.
    *   Combined `status === "loading"` with `(loading && !miPerfil)` in the main render condition for the spinner (`if (status === "loading" || (loading && !miPerfil))`). This means the spinner will show if the *session* is loading, or if the *profile data* is loading and not yet available, preventing the spinner from showing during background session revalidation if the profile data is already loaded.
3.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` (Authentication Check Relocation)**: Moved the `session` and `isSupplier` authentication check from inside `useEffect` to the main render function of `ProveedorPage`. This ensures that unauthorized users are redirected immediately and synchronously (`router.push("/login"); return null;`), preventing any potential flickering related to session revalidation attempting to render content before redirecting.

- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Remove supplier's ability to edit profile

### Problem:
The user requested to remove the ability for suppliers to edit their own profiles, as this functionality should be exclusive to administrators.

### Analysis:
- The "Editar Perfil" section, including a link to `/proveedor/editar-perfil`, was present on the `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`**: Removed the `div` containing the "Gesti√≥n de Perfil" section and the `Link` to `/proveedor/editar-perfil`. This removes the UI element that allowed suppliers to access their profile editing page.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Integrate React Query for client-side data caching

### Problem:
The supplier page (`/proveedor`) and the catalog page (`/catalogo`) were re-fetching data every time the user navigated away and then returned, causing unnecessary network requests and visual flickering. The user requested a caching solution.

### Analysis:
- Both `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` and `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` were using `useState` and `useEffect` for data fetching, leading to re-fetches on component remount.
- No client-side caching mechanism was in place to persist data across navigation.
- React Query is a suitable library for this purpose.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Installed Dependencies**: Installed `@tanstack/react-query` and `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`.
2.  **Configured `QueryClientProvider`**: Wrapped the application with `QueryClientProvider` in `src/app/layout.jsx` to make React Query available globally.
3.  **Refactored Data Fetching in `ProveedorPage`**: Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` to use `useQuery` for fetching `miPerfil`, replacing the manual `useState`/`useEffect` logic. Adjusted loading and error handling to use `useQuery`'s states. **Refined the `enabled` option in `useQuery` to `!!session?.user?.isSupplier && !!session?.user?.id` to ensure the query only runs when `session.user.id` is fully available, preventing premature queries or `queryKey` changes.**
4.  **Refactored Data Fetching in `ComunidadDise√±os` (Catalog Page)**: Modified `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to use `useQuery` for fetching `allDesigns`, replacing the manual `useState`/`useEffect` logic. Adjusted loading and error handling to use `useQuery`'s states.
5.  **Fixed "Only plain objects" Error with QueryClientProvider**: Resolved the serialization error by creating a dedicated client component (`src/app/providers.jsx`) to encapsulate the `QueryClient` instance creation and the `QueryClientProvider`, ensuring the `QueryClient` is instantiated in a client environment.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/layout.jsx`
- `src/app/providers.jsx`
- `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`
- `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`
- `package.json` (due to npm install)
- `package-lock.json` (due to npm install)

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Refactor design editing form to use common components

### Problem:
The `FormEditarDesign.jsx` component was using native HTML input elements with custom styling, leading to duplicated code and inconsistent UI compared to existing common input components.

### Analysis:
- Identified `FormEditarDesign.jsx` as the target for refactoring.
- Scanned `src/components/common/inputs/` for reusable input components.
- Found `InputGeneral.jsx` suitable for text, textarea, and number inputs.
- Found `InputFiles.jsx` suitable for file inputs, requiring an `accept` prop modification.
- The `handleChange` and `handleSubmit` functions were compatible with the common components.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  Imported `InputGeneral` and `InputFiles` into `src/components/perfil/FormEditarDesign.jsx`.
2.  Replaced `input` elements for `nombreDesing`, `valorDesing`, `categoria`, and `tallasDisponibles` with `InputGeneral` components.
3.  Replaced `textarea` element for `descripcion` with `InputGeneral` component with `type="textarea"`.
4.  Replaced `input type="file"` for `imagenDesing` with `InputFiles` component, passing `accept="image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp"`.

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/perfil/FormEditarDesign.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.
