## Current Session: Refactor Email Sending in ProveedorActions, Update Memory Bank Directives, and Self-Correction (2025-06-15)

This session involved correcting a critical oversight in API usage verification, refactoring email sending logic, and updating memory bank directives based on user feedback and self-reflection.

**Changes Made:**
- **Self-Correction & Refactoring**: Identified and corrected an error where `src/app/acciones/ProveedorActions.js` was still calling the now-deleted `/api/email` API route. The `crearProveedor` function was refactored to directly use the `transporter` from `src/utils/nodemailer.js` for email sending, centralizing the email configuration as intended.
- **Memory Bank Updates**:
    - Updated `memory-bank/improvement_log.md` with "Error 8: Insufficient API Usage Verification Before Deletion". This new lesson emphasizes the need for multi-faceted and robust search patterns (including dynamic URL constructions) when verifying API call sites before deletion, especially in Server Actions.
    - Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with a new directive: "Documentaci√≥n de Funcionalidades Nuevas/Modificadas". This mandates clear and concise documentation for new or modified functionalities, detailing how they work, which files are involved, and how they are used.
- **Previous Changes (from earlier in session)**:
    - Deleted `src/app/api/email/route.js` and its empty parent directory `src/app/api/email/`. Initial searches indicated no calls to this API, but this was later found to be incorrect for `ProveedorActions.js`.
