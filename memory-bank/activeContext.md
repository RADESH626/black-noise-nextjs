## Task: Fix supplier dashboard redirection

### Problem:
When a supplier logs in, they are not redirected to their specific dashboard (`/proveedor/pedidos`) but instead to `/catalogo`, and then potentially to `/proveedor` by middleware, and then finally redirected back to `/login`. The issue persisted even after initial fixes and client-side redirect disabling. Additionally, an error "Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components" was encountered when fetching orders.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Redirection Issue:** `src/components/layout/general/forms/FormLogin.jsx` handles client-side redirection based on `state.data.userRole` returned by `loginAction`. `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js` (`loginAction` function) was authenticating suppliers but not explicitly setting `userRole: 'PROVEVEEDOR'` in the returned `data` object. This caused `FormLogin` to default to `/catalogo` for suppliers.
- **Subsequent Redirection to Login (Root Cause):** The `authorize` callback in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` was authenticating suppliers through the `Usuario` model path first. If a `Usuario` with `rol: PROVEEDOR` is found, the `authorize` callback would return an object with `isSupplier: false` (hardcoded for the `Usuario` path), even though the `Proveedor` specific authentication path (which sets `isSupplier: true`) was not reached. This `isSupplier: false` was then propagated to the client-side session, causing the redirect from `/proveedor/pedidos`.
- **"Only plain objects" Error:** The `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` server action in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` was returning Mongoose documents (or objects with `ObjectId` buffers) that were not fully converted to plain JavaScript objects, causing an error when passed to the client-side `ListaPedidosProveedorPage`.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js`**: In the `loginAction` function, added `userRole: 'PROVEEDOR'` to the `data` object returned upon successful supplier authentication.
2.  **Modified `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`**:
    *   In the `authorize` callback, changed `rol: null` to `rol: Rol.PROVEEDOR` for authenticated suppliers.
    *   Refactored the `authorize` callback to correctly handle users with `rol: PROVEEDOR`: If a `Usuario` with `rol: PROVEEDOR` is authenticated, it now explicitly fetches the associated `Proveedor` document and sets `isSupplier: true` and `proveedorId` in the session object returned by `authorize`. This ensures `isSupplier` is correctly `true` for suppliers.
3.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`**: Applied `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to the data returned by `guardarPedido` and `toPlainObject` to the data returned from `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` to ensure all Mongoose documents and `ObjectId`s are converted to plain JavaScript objects with string IDs before being passed to client components.
4.  **Reverted temporary debugging changes**: All temporary changes in `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` and `src/middleware.js` have been reverted.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js`
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`
- `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`
- `src/middleware.js` (reverted to original state)
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` (reverted to original state)

### Next Steps:
- Verify the fix by logging in as a supplier.
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Implement custom header for supplier view

### Problem:
The user requested a custom header for the supplier view (`/proveedor/pedidos`) instead of the general `HeaderPrincipal`. This new header should display the app title on the left and the logged-in supplier's name, and now also include a logout button, using the general button component, with black text.

### Analysis:
- The previous `HeaderPrincipal` component was removed from `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`.
- A new component, `HeaderProveedor.jsx`, was created in `src/components/layout/proveedor/`.
- This new component will use `next-auth/react` to access the session and display the supplier's name and a logout button.
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` will then import and render `HeaderProveedor`.
- The logout button needs to use the `BotonGeneral` component from `src/components/common/botones/`, and its text color should be black.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Reverted `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**: Removed the `HeaderPrincipal` import and component rendering.
2.  **Created `src/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor.jsx`**:
    *   Implemented a new React component that imports `useSession`, `signOut`, `Link`, and `BotonGeneral`.
    *   Displays "Black Noise" as the app title on the left.
    *   Conditionally displays "Bienvenido, {session.user.name}" if the session and user name are available.
    *   Added a "Cerrar Sesión" button using the `BotonGeneral` component that calls `signOut({ callbackUrl: '/login' })` on click.
    *   Styled with Tailwind CSS for basic layout, ensuring the logout button has `text-black`.
3.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**:
    *   Imported `HeaderProveedor` from `@/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor`.
    *   Rendered the `<HeaderProveedor />` component at the top of both `return` statements to ensure it's always present.
    *   Ensured the content of the `return` statements is wrapped in `Fragment` (`<>...</>`) tags to allow multiple top-level elements.

## Task: Prevent unnecessary page refresh on supplier page re-entry and flickering

### Problem:
The supplier page (`/proveedor`) was fully refreshing (re-fetching data and showing a loading spinner) every time the user navigated away and then returned to it, and also "flickered" when switching tabs.

### Analysis:
- The `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` component is a Client Component.
- It uses a `useEffect` hook to fetch supplier profile data (`obtenerMiPerfilProveedor`).
- The `useEffect` was configured to re-run the data fetch whenever its dependencies (`session`, `status`, `router`) changed, which happens on component remount or session state updates, leading to unnecessary re-fetching and display of the loading spinner.
- The "flickering" was caused by the `LoadingSpinner` being displayed even when `miPerfil` data was already present, due to `useSession` revalidating the session and briefly setting `loading` to true, and potentially by delayed authentication checks.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` (Initial Fetch Optimization)**: Adjusted the `useEffect` hook to include a condition (`!miPerfil`) before calling `fetchMiPerfil`. This ensures that the data is only fetched if `miPerfil` is `null` or `undefined`, preventing redundant data loading when the user returns to the page and the profile data is already present.
2.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` (Loading State Refinement & Flicker Fix)**:
    *   Initialized the `loading` state based on `useSession`'s initial `status` (`useState(status === "loading")`).
    *   Ensured `setLoading(true)` when `status` is "loading" inside `useEffect`.
    *   Added `miPerfil` to `useEffect` dependencies to react to its changes.
    *   Explicitly set `setLoading(false)` if `miPerfil` is already loaded and session is authenticated.
    *   Combined `status === "loading"` with `(loading && !miPerfil)` in the main render condition for the spinner (`if (status === "loading" || (loading && !miPerfil))`). This means the spinner will show if the *session* is loading, or if the *profile data* is loading and not yet available, preventing the spinner from showing during background session revalidation if the profile data is already loaded.
3.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` (Authentication Check Relocation)**: Moved the `session` and `isSupplier` authentication check from inside `useEffect` to the main render function of `ProveedorPage`. This ensures that unauthorized users are redirected immediately and synchronously (`router.push("/login"); return null;`), preventing any potential flickering related to session revalidation attempting to render content before redirecting.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Remove supplier's ability to edit profile

### Problem:
The user requested to remove the ability for suppliers to edit their own profiles, as this functionality should be exclusive to administrators.

### Analysis:
- The "Editar Perfil" section, including a link to `/proveedor/editar-perfil`, was present on the `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`**: Removed the `div` containing the "Gestión de Perfil" section and the `Link` to `/proveedor/editar-perfil`. This removes the UI element that allowed suppliers to access their profile editing page.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Integrate React Query for client-side data caching

### Problem:
The supplier page (`/proveedor`) and the catalog page (`/catalogo`) were re-fetching data every time the user navigated away and then returned, causing unnecessary network requests and visual flickering. The user requested a caching solution.

### Analysis:
- Both `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` and `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` were using `useState` and `useEffect` for data fetching, leading to re-fetches on component remount.
- No client-side caching mechanism was in place to persist data across navigation.
- React Query is a suitable library for this purpose.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Installed Dependencies**: Installed `@tanstack/react-query` and `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`.
2.  **Configured `QueryClientProvider`**: Wrapped the application with `QueryClientProvider` in `src/app/layout.jsx` to make React Query available globally.
3.  **Refactored Data Fetching in `ProveedorPage`**: Modified `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` to use `useQuery` for fetching `miPerfil`, replacing the manual `useState`/`useEffect` logic. Adjusted loading and error handling to use `useQuery`'s states.
4.  **Refactored Data Fetching in `ComunidadDiseños` (Catalog Page)**: Modified `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx` to use `useQuery` for fetching `allDesigns`, replacing the manual `useState`/`useEffect` logic. Adjusted loading and error handling to use `useQuery`'s states.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/layout.jsx`
- `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx`
- `src/app/catalogo/page.jsx`
- `package.json` (due to npm install)
- `package-lock.json` (due to npm install)

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.
