# Session Change Log

## Task: Refactor - Store design images as binary data in MongoDB instead of Base64

### Description:
Modified the system to store design images directly as binary data in MongoDB using the `BinData` type, replacing the previous Base64 string storage. This aims to improve storage efficiency, reduce data size, and enhance performance.

### Changes Made:
1.  **Modified `src/models/Design.js`**:
    *   Replaced the `imagenDesing` field with `imageData` of type `Buffer` and `required: true`.
    *   Added a new field `imageMimeType` of type `String` and `required: true`.

### Files Modified:
- `src/models/Design.js`
- `memory-bank/functionalities/DesignImageManagement.md`
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

## Task: Implement and Improve Error Handling for Design Image Management

### Description:
Implemented robust error handling for image uploads in both backend and frontend components, ensuring clear feedback to the user for invalid file types, excessive file sizes, and other upload-related issues.

### Changes Made:
1.  **Backend (`src/app/acciones/DesignActions.js`)**:
    *   Added validation for `imageFile` to ensure it's a valid `File` instance.
    *   Implemented MIME type validation (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`) for both `guardarDesigns` and `actualizarDesign`.
    *   Added file size validation (max 15MB) for both `guardarDesigns` and `actualizarDesign`.
    *   Provided specific error messages for invalid file, unsupported type, and oversized files.
2.  **Frontend (`src/components/perfil/DesignUploadModal.jsx`)**:
    *   Implemented client-side validation for image file type and size before submission.
    *   Updated `handleFileChange` to immediately provide feedback and clear the input if validation fails.
    *   Ensured backend error messages are displayed via `setError` and `showPopUp`.
3.  **Frontend (`src/app/admin/designs/editar/[id]/page.jsx`)**:
    *   Implemented client-side validation for image file type and size when a new image is selected for update.
    *   Updated `handleFileChange` to immediately provide feedback and clear the input if validation fails.
    *   Ensured backend error messages are displayed via `setError` and `showPopUp`.
    *   Corrected a duplicate `export default` statement.
