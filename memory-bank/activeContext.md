## Task: Fix supplier dashboard redirection

### Problem:
When a supplier logs in, they are not redirected to their specific dashboard (`/proveedor/pedidos`) but instead to `/catalogo`, and then potentially to `/proveedor` by middleware, and then finally redirected back to `/login`. The issue persisted even after initial fixes and client-side redirect disabling. Additionally, an error "Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components" was encountered when fetching orders.

### Analysis:
- **Initial Redirection Issue:** `src/components/layout/general/forms/FormLogin.jsx` handles client-side redirection based on `state.data.userRole` returned by `loginAction`. `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js` (`loginAction` function) was authenticating suppliers but not explicitly setting `userRole: 'PROVEVEEDOR'` in the returned `data` object. This caused `FormLogin` to default to `/catalogo` for suppliers.
- **Subsequent Redirection to Login (Root Cause):** The `authorize` callback in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` was authenticating suppliers through the `Usuario` model path first. If a `Usuario` with `rol: PROVEEDOR` is found, the `authorize` callback would return an object with `isSupplier: false` (hardcoded for the `Usuario` path), even though the `Proveedor` specific authentication path (which sets `isSupplier: true`) was not reached. This `isSupplier: false` was then propagated to the client-side session, causing the redirect from `/proveedor/pedidos`.
- **"Only plain objects" Error:** The `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` server action in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` was returning Mongoose documents (or objects with `ObjectId` buffers) that were not fully converted to plain JavaScript objects, causing an error when passed to the client-side `ListaPedidosProveedorPage`.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js`**: In the `loginAction` function, added `userRole: 'PROVEEDOR'` to the `data` object returned upon successful supplier authentication.
2.  **Modified `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`**:
    *   In the `authorize` callback, changed `rol: null` to `rol: Rol.PROVEEDOR` for authenticated suppliers.
    *   Refactored the `authorize` callback to correctly handle users with `rol: PROVEEDOR`: If a `Usuario` with `rol: PROVEEDOR` is authenticated, it now explicitly fetches the associated `Proveedor` document and sets `isSupplier: true` and `proveedorId` in the session object returned by `authorize`. This ensures `isSupplier` is correctly `true` for suppliers.
3.  **Modified `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`**: Applied `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to the data returned by `guardarPedido` and `toPlainObject` to the data returned by `obtenerPedidosPorProveedorId` to ensure all Mongoose documents and `ObjectId`s are converted to plain JavaScript objects with string IDs before being passed to client components.
4.  **Reverted temporary debugging changes**: All temporary changes in `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` and `src/middleware.js` have been reverted.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/acciones/UsuariosActions.js`
- `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`
- `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js`
- `src/middleware.js` (reverted to original state)
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` (reverted to original state)

### Next Steps:
- Verify the fix by logging in as a supplier.
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.

## Task: Implement custom header for supplier view

### Problem:
The user requested a custom header for the supplier view (`/proveedor/pedidos`) instead of the general `HeaderPrincipal`. This new header should display the app title on the left and the logged-in supplier's name, and now also include a logout button, using the general button component, with black text.

### Analysis:
- The previous `HeaderPrincipal` component was removed from `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`.
- A new component, `HeaderProveedor.jsx`, was created in `src/components/layout/proveedor/`.
- This new component will use `next-auth/react` to access the session and display the supplier's name and a logout button.
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx` will then import and render `HeaderProveedor`.
- The logout button needs to use the `BotonGeneral` component from `src/components/common/botones/`, and its text color should be black.

### Solution Implemented:
1.  **Reverted `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**: Removed the `HeaderPrincipal` import and component rendering.
2.  **Created `src/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor.jsx`**:
    *   Implemented a new React component that imports `useSession`, `signOut`, `Link`, and `BotonGeneral`.
    *   Displays "Black Noise" as the app title on the left.
    *   Conditionally displays "Bienvenido, {session.user.name}" if the session and user name are available.
    *   Added a "Cerrar Sesi√≥n" button using the `BotonGeneral` component that calls `signOut({ callbackUrl: '/login' })` on click.
    *   Styled with Tailwind CSS for basic layout, ensuring the logout button has `text-black`.
3.  **Modified `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`**:
    *   Imported `HeaderProveedor` from `@/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor`.
    *   Rendered the `<HeaderProveedor />` component at the top of both `return` statements to ensure it's always present.
    *   Ensured the content of the `return` statements is wrapped in `Fragment` (`<>...</>`) tags to allow multiple top-level elements.

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/proveedor/pedidos/page.jsx`
- `src/components/layout/proveedor/HeaderProveedor.jsx`

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Propose Git commands.
