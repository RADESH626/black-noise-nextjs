# Session Change Log

## Task: Implement notification for new orders

### Changes Made:
- Added a `console.log` statement in `src/app/acciones/PedidoActions.js` within the `guardarPedido` function to log the ID of a newly created order.

### Rationale:
- To fulfill the user's request to "ver cuando un nuevo pedido se agrego a la base de datos", a simple console log was implemented to provide immediate feedback during development when an order is successfully saved.

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Generate git commit command.

## Task: Align internal documentation with new operational directives

### Changes Made:
- Updated `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with Cline's new operational directives, including principles, memory bank structure, project intelligence, unified workflow (with mermaid diagram), task scope definition, verification/self-correction protocol, and session logging/version control.
- Added a note to `memory-bank/project_overview.md` referencing the updated operational directives in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Added a note to `memory-bank/techContext.md` referencing the updated operational directives in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Updated the description for `systemPatterns.md` in `memory-bank/manifest.md` to reflect that it now includes Cline's operational directives.

### Rationale:
- To ensure Cline's internal documentation accurately reflects the new operating rules provided by the user, enhancing clarity and adherence to the defined workflow.

### Next Steps:
- Update `progress.md`.
- Generate git commit command.

## Task: Refactor payment flow for order creation and payment from history

### Changes Made:
- Updated `memory-bank/functionalities/Cart.md` to reflect the change of the "Pagar Ahora" button to "Realizar Pedido" and clarify the order creation flow.
- Created `memory-bank/functionalities/GestionDePedidosYPagos.md` to document the new order history logic, payment modal, and backend payment server action.
- Modified `src/components/common/CartComponent.jsx`:
    - Renamed the "Pagar Ahora" button to "Realizar Pedido".
    - Removed the payment confirmation modal and redirection logic from `handleCreateOrder`, as payment is now handled from order history.
- Refactored `src/components/common/PedidosComponent.jsx`:
    - Integrated `useSession` and `obtenerPedidosPorUsuarioId` to fetch user orders.
    - Implemented conditional rendering for a "Pagar" button for orders with `estadoPago: "PENDIENTE"`.
    - Integrated `useModal` and `PaymentModal` to open the payment modal with `pedidoId` and `valorPedido`.
- Created `src/components/pago/PaymentModal.jsx`:
    - Implemented a payment form to capture card details.
    - Integrated `procesarPagoDePedido` server action for payment processing.
- Modified `src/app/acciones/PagoActions.js`:
    - Added `procesarPagoDePedido` server action to create `Pago` records and update `Pedido` status.
    - Imported `Pedido` model and `EditarPedido` from `PedidoActions.js`.
    - Changed `estadoTransaccion: 'COMPLETADO'` to `estadoTransaccion: 'PAGADO'` for consistency.
- Modified `src/models/Pago.js`:
    - Changed `ventaId` to `pedidoId` and made it required, linking payments directly to orders.
- Modified `src/models/enums/pago/EstadoPago.js`:
    - Changed `REALIZADO` to `PAGADO` for consistency with the new payment flow.

### Rationale:
- To implement the new payment flow as per user requirements, separating order creation from payment and enabling payment from the order history via a modal. This refactoring improves user experience and system architecture.

### Next Steps:
- Generate git commit command.

## Task: Fix runtime error in PedidosComponent.jsx

### Changes Made:
- Modified `src/components/common/PedidosComponent.jsx`:
    - Replaced `pedido.productos[0]?.img` with `pedido.items[0]?.designId?.imagenDesing`.
    - Replaced `pedido.productos[0]?.nombre` with `pedido.items[0]?.designId?.nombreDesing`.
    - Added a conditional check (`pedido.items && pedido.items.length > 0`) around the image rendering to prevent errors if `pedido.items` is empty or undefined.

### Rationale:
- The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '0')" occurred because `PedidosComponent.jsx` was expecting a `productos` array with `img` and `nombre` properties, while the `Pedido` model and `obtenerPedidosPorUsuarioId` server action provide an `items` array with `designId.imagenDesing` and `designId.nombreDesing`. This fix aligns the component's data access with the actual data structure.

### Next Steps:
- Generate git commit command.

## Task: Fix 'toFixed' error in PedidosComponent.jsx

### Changes Made:
- Modified `src/components/common/PedidosComponent.jsx`:
    - Replaced `pedido.total` with `pedido.valorPedido` for displaying the total and in the `handlePayOrder` function.

### Rationale:
- The error occurred because `PedidosComponent.jsx` was attempting to access `pedido.total`, which was `undefined`. The `Pedido` model defines the order total as `valorPedido`. This fix aligns the component's data access with the actual data structure.

### Next Steps:
- Generate git commit command.
