## Task: Fix - Optimize ProfileContent.jsx data fetching

### Description:
Refactored the `useEffect` and state handling in `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx` to eliminate redundant client-side data fetching, ensuring efficient use of initial data provided by the Server Component.

### Changes Made:
1.  **Modified `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`**:
    *   Removed the conditional logic within `fetchUserData` that was previously fetching user designs if `initialUserDesigns` was empty. The `userDesigns` state is now solely initialized from the `initialUserDesigns` prop.
    *   Confirmed that the `useEffect` hook correctly depends only on `[userId, status]`.
    *   Verified that `userDesigns` and `orderedDesignIds` states are initialized directly from their respective `initialUserDesigns` and `initialOrderedDesignIds` props.

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`
