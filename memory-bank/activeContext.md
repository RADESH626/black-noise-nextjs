# Active Context Log

## Task: Resolve repeated console logs in ProfileContent.jsx

### Changes Made:
- **File:** `src/components/layout/ProfileContent.jsx`
  - **Description:** Moved initial client-side debugging `console.log` statements into a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array (`[]`). This ensures the logs execute only once when the component mounts, preventing repetition on subsequent re-renders caused by state updates or tab changes.

### Next Steps:
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Generate Git commit commands.
