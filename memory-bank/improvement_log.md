## Lessons Learned:

### 2025-09-06 - Git Command Chaining on Windows (CMD)
**Error:** Attempted to chain `git add . && git commit -m "message"` using `&&` operator in a single `execute_command` call. This failed because `cmd.exe` (the default shell on Windows) does not interpret `&&` for command chaining in the same way as Unix-like shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh).
**Correction:** For Windows `cmd.exe`, `git add .` and `git commit -m "message"` must be executed as separate commands.
**Rule Update:** When performing `git add` and `git commit`, always execute `git add .` first, wait for its successful completion, and then execute `git commit -m "message"`. Do not attempt to chain these commands with `&&` on Windows.

### 2025-09-06 - Typo in Model Reference (`Proveador` instead of `Proveedor`)
**Error:** During a `replace_in_file` operation, a typo was introduced, changing `Proveedor` (the correct model name) to `Proveador`. This resulted in a `ReferenceError: Proveador is not defined`.
**Correction:** The typo was corrected by changing `Proveador` back to `Proveedor`.
**Lesson Learned:** Always double-check spelling, especially when modifying existing code or introducing new references, to avoid subtle but critical `ReferenceError` issues. Pay close attention to character-for-character accuracy in code modifications.

### 2025-09-06 - User Preference: Denying `attempt_completion` with `command`
**Observation:** The user may deny `attempt_completion` when a `command` is provided, even if the task is complete. This does not necessarily mean the task is incomplete or that there's an error.
**Reasoning:** The user indicated that this might be because the project is already running, or they do not wish to review the change immediately by running the command.
**Rule Update:** When `attempt_completion` is denied after a `command` is provided, and no explicit error feedback is given, consider the possibility that the user simply does not want to execute the command at that moment. In such cases, ask for clarification if the task is truly complete or if further actions are required, rather than assuming an error in the solution.

### 2025-09-06 - Next.js Module Not Found (Malformed Import String Literal)
**Error:** Encountered "Module not found" errors in `src/app/proveedor/page.jsx` where the compiler reported import paths with apparent malformed string literals (e.g., `''components/common/LoadingSpinner''`). The file content, when read by the model, showed correct `@/` aliased paths with single quotes. This discrepancy suggested a compiler parsing or caching issue rather than a direct typo in the source code.
**Correction:** The issue was resolved by performing a `replace_in_file` operation on the affected import lines, replacing them with identical content. This action effectively forced the Next.js compiler to re-evaluate and correctly parse the import string literals, resolving the "Module not found" error.
**Rule Update:** If a "Module not found" error occurs in a Next.js application, and the import path appears correct in the source file, consider re-saving the file or performing a no-op `replace_in_file` on the problematic import lines. This can often resolve compiler caching or parsing inconsistencies.
