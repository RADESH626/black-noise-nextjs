# Improvement Log

## Lessons Learned:

### 2025-09-06 - Git Command Chaining on Windows (CMD)
**Error:** Attempted to chain `git add . && git commit -m "message"` using `&&` operator in a single `execute_command` call. This failed because `cmd.exe` (the default shell on Windows) does not interpret `&&` for command chaining in the same way as Unix-like shells (e.g., Bash, Zsh).
**Correction:** For Windows `cmd.exe`, `git add .` and `git commit -m "message"` must be executed as separate commands.
**Rule Update:** When performing `git add` and `git commit`, always execute `git add .` first, wait for its successful completion, and then execute `git commit -m "message"`. Do not attempt to chain these commands with `&&` on Windows.

### 2025-09-06 - Typo in Model Reference (`Proveador` instead of `Proveedor`)
**Error:** During a `replace_in_file` operation, a typo was introduced, changing `Proveedor` (the correct model name) to `Proveador`. This resulted in a `ReferenceError: Proveador is not defined`.
**Correction:** The typo was corrected by changing `Proveador` back to `Proveedor`.
**Lesson Learned:** Always double-check spelling, especially when modifying existing code or introducing new references, to avoid subtle but critical `ReferenceError` issues. Pay close attention to character-for-character accuracy in code modifications.
